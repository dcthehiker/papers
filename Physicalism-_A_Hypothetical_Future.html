<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Considering the most recent advances in artificial intelligence and
biomechanics, a hypothetical future of physicalism is explored. It is
concluded that a rational and sensible extrapolation of present and
expected future advances in those two areas will have vast consequences
in the physicalist view. In particular, it is also argued that
consciousness cannot be defined in a simple general manner, but only
understood through the observable and behavioural actions of humans or
sufficiently advanced robots, which may be, at some future time,
indistinct. This last result is established by applying what we call
Plato’s trap, and our main conclusion is a defence of physicalism. It is
argued that human beings are robots which soon will be indistinguishable
from suitable advanced man-made robots, which will in turn render many
philosophical questions and objections to physicalism irrelevant and, in
fact, quite similar in sense and importance to some philosophical
medieval questions about God, the soul and immortality.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Many books and articles have been written about physicalism (Kim,
2005; Soljar, 2010; Elpidorou &amp; Drove, 2020), and undoubtedly, there
are many interpretations of this term. In this article, by physicalism,
we mean the doctrine that states that everything that is actual is
physical. This states the general features of physicalism, therefore; a
physicalist world could not contain platonic entities, spirits, angels
or Cartesian souls, among other nonphysical entities. Physicalism is the
philosophical view that everything in the universe is ultimately made up
of physical matter, and that all phenomena, including mental states,
consciousness and the mind can be fully explained in terms of physical
processes and properties.</p>
<p>According to physicalism, there is no non-physical realm, and
everything that exists, including thoughts, emotions and consciousness,
can be reduced to and explained by physical interactions and processes
(Chalmers, 1996; Dasgupta, 2014; Montero, 2013). Physicalists believe
that the laws of physics are sufficient to explain all natural
phenomena, including the behavior of living organisms and the workings
of the human mind. They also reject the existence of any non-physical
entities, such as souls, spirits or supernatural forces that may be used
to explain aspects of reality beyond the physical realm.</p>
<p>Some consider that one of the key challenges for physicalism is to
account for subjective experiences such as the qualia of perception,
which some argue cannot be fully explained by physical processes alone.
However, physicalists respond to this challenge by arguing that
subjective experiences are ultimately reducible to physical
processes.</p>
<p>Physicalism is a popular view among philosophers and scientists who
seek to provide a unified and comprehensive explanation of the natural
world.</p>
<p>As it is well known, some of the main objections to physicalism
include the following:</p>
<p>The hard problem of consciousness: Some consider that physicalism
struggles to account for subjective experience, or the “qualia” of
consciousness, such as the subjective experience of pain or the taste of
chocolate. They consider it challenging to explain how subjective
experiences can arise from physical processes alone, leading some
philosophers to reject physicalism as an incomplete account of the
nature of reality.</p>
<p>The knowledge argument: This argument proposes that physicalism
cannot account for the “knowledge” that comes with subjective
experiences, even if they can be fully described in physical terms. For
example, they argue that a person who has never tasted chocolate but has
read about it extensively could still not fully grasp the subjective
experience of tasting it, even with a complete physical description of
the experience.</p>
<p>The problem of mental causation: If all mental processes and states
can be reduced to physical processes, then they consider it difficult to
explain how mental states can have any causal power or influence on
physical processes. This, they argue, raises questions about how we can
make decisions, act intentionally, or even hold people accountable for
their actions.</p>
<p>The problem of other minds: Some ponder that physicalism struggles to
explain how we can know that other people have subjective experiences or
consciousness, as we can only directly experience our own
consciousness.</p>
<p>Overall, some philosophers consider that the objections to
physicalism raise fundamental questions about the nature of
consciousness, subjectivity and the relationship between the physical
and the mental. These debates continue to shape contemporary philosophy
of mind and cognitive science.</p>
<p>On the other hand, physicalists offer several responses to the
previous main objections to physicalism, including:</p>
<p>The hard problem of consciousness: Physicalists argue that while
subjective experience may be difficult to explain, it is not an
insurmountable problem. Some physicalist theories, such as the
Integrated Information Theory or the Global Workspace Theory, propose
that consciousness arises from complex patterns of neural activity,
while others suggest that consciousness may be a fundamental property of
the universe, like space and time.</p>
<p>The knowledge argument: Physicalists respond to this argument by
pointing out that subjective experiences are not separate from physical
processes, but rather are aspects of them. Therefore, a complete
physical description of an experience should be sufficient to capture
all of its properties.</p>
<p>The problem of mental causation: Physicalists argue that mental
states can have causal power without being separate from physical
processes. Mental states can be viewed as different levels of
explanation that are grounded in physical processes. For example, a
decision to move one’s arm can be explained both in terms of the firing
of neurons in the brain and in terms of the person’s intention or desire
to move.</p>
<p>The problem of other minds: Physicalists argue that the existence of
other minds can be inferred from behavioral and neuroscientific
evidence, as well as from the fact that other people are capable of
complex language use and can report on their own subjective
experiences.</p>
<p>Overall, physicalists offer various responses to the objections to
physicalism, but the debates around the nature of consciousness,
subjectivity and mental causation continue to be topics of ongoing
research and discussion in philosophy and cognitive science. In this
article, it is argued that once accepting that everything around us (us
included) is guided exclusively by matter and physical laws, the
so-called problems of physicalisms are in fact pseudo problems.</p>
<h2 id="modern-turing-test-with-advanced-robots-and-platos-trap">2.
Modern Turing Test with Advanced Robots and Plato’s Trap</h2>
<p>Turing’s paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (Turing, 1950)
opens with the words: “I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines
think?’”. However since “thinking” is difficult to define, he chose to
have this question substituted by another, which he considered to be
closely related. In order to do this, he proposed the “imitation game”,
which is a test of a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior
equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of a human. Turing’s new
question therefore became “Are there imaginable digital computers which
would do well in the imitation game?”</p>
<p>As it is known, in the imitation game, which later became known as
“Turing test”, the conversation between the participants is limited to a
text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen. If the
participant is not able to reliably distinguish between a machine and a
human, then the machine would be said to have passed the test. It is
important to stress that the result does not depend on the machine’s
ability to provide correct answers to questions, but only on how closely
its answers resembled those a human would give. The Turing test is a
test of indistinguishability in performance capacity. The capacity of
modern’s artificial intelligence programs and computers is such that not
only in text-only channels, but also with an artificial human-like
voice, this test would be successfully passed by most computer systems
and artificial intelligence programs of today; that is, humans are
unable to distinguish between another human and a computer.</p>
<p>As an example of today AI capabilities, the following article by Zoe
(2023) describes “A ChatGPT-style AI assistant, developed by Microsoft
and embedded into its office apps”. It is interesting to know that both
Europe’s AI act and China’s AI regulations state that people must know
if they are interacting with artificial intelligence rather than humans.
These regulations show how easy modern Artificial Intelligence systems
can cheat and fool humans, making them believe that they are dealing
with other humans. This also emphasizes the fact that, nowadays, AI
systems are indistinguishable from humans. It is worth remembering that
in 1642, Blaise Pascal designed a calculator machine, and four hundred
years have passed since Pascale birth. Could anybody at that time have
imagined the artificial intelligence machines we have now? Following
with this comparison we may ask: Could anyone today imagine the
humanoids which will be available in the next four hundred years? We may
agree that both of these questions are very speculative, but we may also
reflect on how many scientific and technological developments have had a
deep impact on our philosophical doubts.</p>
<p>In a similar way to the “Turing test”, here, I propose considering
the question “What is consciousness?”. We know that a general accepted
definition of this term is; “the state of being aware of and responsive
to one’s surroundings”. However, before dealing with this question, and
following Turing’s path, I intend instead to consider the question: “Can
machines imitate a being with conscious behavior?”, or “Could a machine
show a conscious behavior, equivalent to or indistinguishable from that
of a human?” Many books and articles about physicalism consider that
consciousness is a principal challenge. For example, Kim (2005: p. 1)
asks: “Is the mental reducible to the physical? In particular, can we
give a reductive physicalist account of consciousness?”, concluding that
“phenomenal consciousness resists physical reduction”; however, it is
not explained what is understood by “physical reduction”. For example,
from a physicalist point of view, we may understand the behavior of a
simple pendulum. Giving its mass, pendulum length and earth gravity
acceleration, we may provide a model based on known physical laws, which
very precisely describe the period and frequency of the pendulum
oscillations that we observe. It is important to underline that a
physical reduction must lead to a result which is observable, and not to
a metaphysical definition.</p>
<p>As a first test, imagine a being (which may be human or artificial,
to which we have no direct access, and which is unaware or our observing
it, under the clear assumption that if it is an artificial machine, it
is physically indistinguishable from a human, an assumption that is not
too far from today’s biomechanical capacities) locked in a room, which
is being observed by us (humans). How are we going to determine whether
the locked being is human or not? The only possible way to do this is by
analyzing its behavior. After a few hours or days, it may become
desperate of being alone, and it may start crying or asking for help.
After some time, and having pen and paper available, it may start
writing a letter to a friend or a poem about how lonely it feels
confined in that room, or eventually it might try to commit suicide and
even succeed in doing it. The most important thing for our discussion is
that, as an artificial entity, anything such being may do may be simply
the result of an artificial intelligence program which was precisely
designed to imitate the behavior of humans. This program might be so
good that it could easily fool human observers.</p>
<p>As a second test, imagine that the being (human or artificial, we do
not know) in the previous example is being confined together with a
group of humans (who do not know its real identity). We can easily
imagine that after some time, some friendship and solidarity links will
be established between all the members of this community. Every possible
human behavior under these stressful circumstances may be observed among
the group of humans and, maybe, non-human beings, such as friendship,
love, hate, quarreling, wailing, weeping and the like, and in the case
of anyone dying, we may imagine that the locked beings, under careful
observation, may show a deep sorrowful behavior. We may add any
imaginable circumstance to this test and, as in the first test, the most
important thing for our discussion is that being an artificial entity,
anything it may do may simply be the result of an artificial
intelligence program which was precisely designed to imitate the
behavior of humans.</p>
<p>We could easily imagine the behavior of this artificial human-like
entity having a behavior that is fully compatible with our human idea of
a person with consciousness, fully aware of itself and its
circumstances. Our conclusion about these conjectures is that what we
call consciousness is nothing else but the result of the behavior of
human or artificial entities, but now, we are left with the naked
question “What is consciousness?”. An answer may well be that this
question does not have a general answer, but even so, we say that
someone, or something, has consciousness when it behaves according to
the human expectations of someone or something that we deem as having
consciousness.</p>
<p>This leads us to what we may call “Plato’s trap”. As we know, in many
of his dialogues Plato tried to answer questions such as “What is
justice?” or “What is beauty?”, among many others (Plato, 2005).</p>
<p>However, Plato was always careful to distinguish the difference
between, let us say, a “just act” or a “beautiful object” and what plain
“justice” or “beauty” is, and for the later question, he had no answer.
We may ask whether we are not in a similar position when we ask what
consciousness is. We cannot answer this question in general, just as we
cannot answer the questions of what justice is or what beauty is. It is
not possible to provide a universal definition of justice, beauty or
consciousness. We can only say that someone (or something) has behaved
justly, or that someone or something is beautiful, or that someone (or
something) has displayed a conscious behavior.</p>
<p>It seems very likely that we will develop robots which will be able
to fool humans because they will exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent
to, or indistinguishable from, that of a conscious human. For any
practical purpose, these robots will have consciousness, and this
confusion will inevitably lead us to recognize that we, humans, are also
nothing else but robotic advanced machines.</p>
<h3 id="top-advanced-humanoid-robots">3.Top Advanced Humanoid
Robots</h3>
<p>According to Analytics Insight, at this moment (see
https://www.analyticsinsight and https://www.pycodemates, 2023),
humanoid robots have been developed to deal with many applications.
These robots include the best advancements in artificial intelligence
and have been improved in order to resemble humans both in their body
and intelligence. At the moment, most applications of these robots
include education, entertainment, personal assistance, manufacturing,
search and rescue, healthcare and many more. Currently, Asimo, developed
by Honda, is considered the world’s most advanced robot, whereas Sophia,
developed by Hanson Robotics, is the most intelligent (assuming that at
this stage of development we can correctly use this word).</p>
<h3 id="asimo">3.1. ASIMO</h3>
<p>ASIMO, or Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility, is a humanoid robot
created for search and rescue missions (see: https://asimo.honda.com/);
it can recognize moving objects, postures, gestures and the surrounding
environment, as well as sounds and faces, allowing it to interact with
humans. Asimo has on its head two camera eyes which capture visual
information to detect the movement of multiple objects and determine
distance and direction. ASIMO can differentiate between voices and other
sounds that enable it to recognize its companions. It responds to
various questions by nodding and speaking in different languages, and
can recognize almost ten different faces and address them by name.</p>
<h3 id="sophia">3.2. Sophia</h3>
<p>Developed by Hanson Robotics (see:
https://www.hansonrobotics.com/sophia/), Sophia is the most advanced
humanoid robot. It made her debut in 2016, attracting audiences all over
the world. Sophia is the world’s first robot citizen and the United
Nations Development Programme’s first robot Innovation Ambassador. She
has appeared on several TV shows, such as Tonight Show and Good Morning
Britain, and it has delivered speeches at hundreds of conferences
worldwide. In understanding human-robot interactions and their services
and entertainment applications, Sophia is a framework for cutting-edge
robotics and AI research. Hanson Robotics, the Hong-Kong based company,
created Sophia to look like the famous Hollywood actress Audrey Hepburn,
in order to fit her as an old age companion in nursing homes or a crowd
manager in events. She has neural networks and AI embedded in her to
recognize human faces and understand their gestures and emotions. Sophia
has become the audience’s favorite by her appearance in high-profile
interviews events and other discussions around the world.</p>
<h3 id="atlas">3.3. Atlas</h3>
<p>Developed by Boston Dynamics in 2013 (see:
https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/) Atlas is a robot with a prime focus
on locomotion, first walking in the lab, then walking on every type of
unstable terrain, and eventually performing some sick Parkour tricks.
The company launched Atlas with funding from the United States Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In addition to identifying
obstacles in the path, avoiding them, bouncing and doing somersaults,
Atlas can perform additional body movements similar to those of
gymnasts. Atlas uses depth sensors for real-time perception and model
predictive control technology to improve motion. Atlas sees two sensors
which are a color camera and a Lidar module producing a colored point
cloud.</p>
<h3 id="ameca">3.4. Ameca</h3>
<p>The world’s most advanced, most realistic humanoid robot is Ameca,
and it was created by Engineered Arts in 2021 (see:
https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/).Ameca’s first video was released
publicly on Dec 1, 2021, and it received a lot of attention on Twitter
and TikTok. It is primarily intended to serve as a platform for the
advancement of robotics technologies involving human-robot interaction.
AMECA employs embedded microphones, binocular eye-mounted cameras, a
chest camera and facial recognition software to interact with the
public. GPT-3 or human telepresence can also control interactions. Its
artificial limbs, ligaments and sensor arrays are all made with
cutting-edge technology.</p>
<h3 id="nadine">3.5. Nadine</h3>
<p>Nadine, is an empathetic robot developed and designed by the
Institute for Media Innovation of Nanyang Technological University and
manufactured by the Kokoro Company in Japan in 2013. Nadine responds to
greetings, makes eye contact, and remembers all comments and
conversations with her, as well as having human-like personality, moods
and emotions. She was created by simulating human behavior with
cutting-edge technology; Nadine has 3D depth cameras, a microphone and a
webcam to collect visual and audio inputs, and then, various perception
layers process these inputs to recognize various faces, gestures,
emotions and behaviors in order to analyze them and respond
appropriately. She has built-in chatbots to handle various queries, and
also a memory model to remember different users and conversations with
them. In addition, Nadine is fluent in six languages: English, Hindi,
French, Japanese, Chinese and German.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">4. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, considering the latest advances in artificial
intelligence and biomechanics, the hypothetical future of physicalism is
explored. It is claimed that a rational and sensible extrapolation of
present and expected future advances in these two areas will have huge
consequences in the physicalist view by eliminating many unworkable
discussions. In particular, it is maintained that consciousness cannot
be defined in a concise manner, as a metaphysical definition, but only
understood through the observable actions and behavior of humans and
sufficiently advanced robots. This last conclusion was established by
applying what we call Plato’s trap, according to which, it is not
possible to provide general definitions for terms like justice or
beauty; instead, we can only state that someone (or something) has
behaved justly, or that someone (or something) is beautiful, or,
extending this argument; that someone (or something) has displayed a
conscious behavior, and therefore is a conscious being. The main
conclusion is a defense of physicalism. Our arguments imply that human
beings are robots and that soon, they will be indistinguishable from
suitable advanced man-made robots. Perhaps the most important conclusion
is that this will render many philosophical questions and objections to
physicalism irrelevant, and in fact, quite similar, in sense and
prominence, to some philosophical medieval questions about God, the soul
and immortality.</p>
