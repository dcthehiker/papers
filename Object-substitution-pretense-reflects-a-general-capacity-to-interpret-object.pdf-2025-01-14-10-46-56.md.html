<p>Revencu, B. Object Substitution Pretense Reflects a General Capacity
to Interpret Objects as Symbols. In press at Psychological Review.</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Nonlinguistic external representations, such as diagrams, animations,
or puppet shows, involve local relations between a perceptually
available object (a symbol) and an entity that is relevant in the
current communicative context (a discourse referent). By analyzing the
empirical evidence on early pretend play, I argue that object
substitution pretense can be fully accounted for if it is conceived of
as a subspecies of external representation. This implies that the
capacity to interpret objects as symbols emerges early and reliably in
human ontogeny. I discuss several accounts of pretend play and related
phenomena and argue that the current proposal provides a better and more
general account of early symbolic understanding than alternative
views.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Despite its high expressive power, language is not always the most
efficient way to convey information. Consider the concept of offside in
European football: “a player is in an offside position if [they are]
closer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the
second-last opponent” (“Offside Association Football”, 2021). For those
who do not already know what offside is, the rule will be difficult to
assimilate from language alone-at least not without parsing the above
sentence several times.</p>
<p>When this happens, humans spontaneously resort to objects that are
available in the immediate environment to depict the objects,
properties, or events they want to communicate about (H. Clark, 2016).
For instance, one can illustrate the offside position by using bottles
for the football players and a coin for the ball. Once these relations
are conveyed to the audience, communicators can manipulate the objects
to create spatial configurations that illustrate the offside position in
a more accessible manner (Figure 1). In turn, the audience must
represent the spatial configuration of the bottles as well as the
relations between the bottles and the corresponding football players.
Failing to do so would make the movement of the bottle uninterpretable
in terms of the football scene the bottles depict.</p>
<p>The ease with which human adults perform this task points to a
cognitive capacity that allows them to interpret arbitrary external
objects as local symbols in a communicative discourse. This capacity
extends beyond the ad-hoc use of surrounding objects. In various media,
such as diagrams, animations, or puppet shows, external objects are used
as temporary stand-ins for other entities. In all these cases, the
spatial configuration and trajectories of the external objects (e.g.,
animated figures, puppets) must be represented and tracked. Yet the
information that is gathered upon doing so ultimately applies to a
different set of entities-the ones that the communicative episode is
actually about (e.g., the characters in a story). Therefore, the ways in
which the external objects are moving (in animations) or are being moved
(in puppet shows) must be interpreted predicatively, as properties
applied to the entities these objects represent.</p>
<p>I use “symbols” to refer to the external trackable objects (e.g., the
bottles in Figure 1), because they stand for entities other than
themselves. While “symbol” has been traditionally used ever since Peirce
(1897/1955) to distinguish arbitrary signs (such as words) from iconic
signs (such as drawings), my use of “symbol” glosses over this
distinction. For an external object to be a symbol, the object must be
used by the communicator to convey information about other entities and
spatiotemporally tracked by the audience to extract the communicated
content. Indeed, one could replace the setup in Figure 1 with a diagram
that replaces the bottles with football player drawings without altering
the cognitive operations needed to extract the offside rule.</p>

<p>Note. The leftmost green bottle/striker (highlighted by the
circumscribed square) is currently behind the last brown bottle/defender
and therefore in an offside position.</p>
<!-- Media -->
<p>In depictions, there are at least three cues that help humans
identify what type of entity a symbol stands for: direct stipulation
(e.g., “Suppose the bottles are the players”), iconicity (e.g.,
resemblance between the football player drawings and football players),
and use (e.g., conveying that the coin is the ball by having it passed
around among the bottles). In many cases, iconicity and use can render
the stipulation aspect of the bottle setup redundant, as the meaning is
more easily recoverable from the objects or actions themselves. However,
the remaining aspects of the setup remain constant. The audience would
still have to interpret the spatial relations among the proximal stimuli
in terms of the entities these stimuli stand for.</p>
<p>The entities that the symbols stand for are usually dubbed
“referents”, but I will refer to them as “discourse referents” (Brody,
2020; Heim, 1982; Kamp &amp; Reyle, 1993; Karttunen, 1976) for two
reasons. First, “discourse referent” does not carry the connotation that
the symbol objects pick out a real-world referent. In the offside
example above, the bottle symbols do not pick out any particular
football player in the world, even though the depiction as a whole does
illustrate a real-world rule. In other words, the football players are
spatiotemporally undefined with respect to the real world and thus local
to the current discourse. For this reason, they need to be not only
represented but also generated internally by the audience. <span
class="math inline"><sup>1</sup></span> Second, “discourse referent”
emphasizes that the link between the referents and the symbols that
stand for them is also local to the current discourse. Once the
pedagogical demonstration of the offside position is over, the link
between the bottles and the football players should be discarded, as
bottles are not to be associated with football players outside of this
episode: they neither are football players, nor should they be expected
to stand for them in the future. Finally, I will use “STAND-FOR
relations” to denote the context-bound relations that hold between a
symbol and a discourse referent.</p>
<p>For a cognitive mechanism to interpret objects as symbols, it should
be capable of at least four operations: (i) track the identity of the
object symbols spatiotemporally via an object indexing system (Pylyshyn,
1989, 2001); (ii) generate a representation of the discourse referents;
(iii) assign each object symbol to its corresponding discourse
referents; (iv) update the information about the discourse referents
conveyed via the spatiotemporal trajectories of the object symbols, as
well as the spatial relations among them, as communication unfolds. I
will argue that this mechanism emerges at the end of infancy at the
latest,when 18-month-olds start engaging in pretend play. <span
class="math inline"><sup>2</sup></span> As object substitution pretense
requires the same cognitive operations as STAND-FOR relations writ
large, an early competence in this domain implies the early emergence of
the capacity to interpret objects as symbols, in both production and
comprehension. I then move on to a discussion of several alternative
views of both pretend play and symbolic understanding and argue that the
current approach provides a better and more general account of the same
phenomena.</p>

<p><span class="math inline"><sup>2</sup></span> While there are cases
of pretend play that do not involve objects,such as role play (e.g.,when
a caregiver pretends that they are a wolf), pretend play involving
object props appears to develop earlier than pretend play that does not
(for a review, see Thompson &amp; Goldstein, 2019), which suggests that
it is more basic. That said, the theoretical model defended here can
accommodate object-less pretense if other kinds of things (e.g., people)
are allowed to play the role of symbols (e.g., an actor standing for a
character).</p>

<p>Not much is known about infants’ early interpretation of symbols.
This topic has been under-addressed in developmental research, even
though representational stimuli are routinely used to tap into infants’
cognitive processes (e.g., Gergely et al., 1995; Liu et al., 2017;
Powell &amp; Spelke, 2013).</p>
<p>Moreover, the little that is known has been used as evidence that
infants do not possess an early SYMBOL concept. On the one hand, infants
perceptually discriminate 2D representations from 3D objects before
their first birthday (DeLoache et al., 1979) and correctly identify the
objects represented, possibly even in the absence of experience
(Hochberg &amp; Brooks, 1962). This does not show that infants interpret
the pictures as representations - that is, by establishing a link
between a perceptually available object and a discourse referent.
Instead, infants could respond to some other cue, such as surface
similarity. On the other hand, while able to discriminate between 2D and
3D stimuli, infants sometimes mistakenly treat photographs and videos as
3D objects and try to grasp them (DeLoache et al., 1998; Pierroutsakos
&amp; Troseth, 2003). This is often cited as evidence against the claim
that infants understand symbolic relations (e.g., DeLoache, 2004;
Spelke, 2022).</p>
<p>This inference can be questioned on two grounds. First, the inference
mistakes the distinction between 2D and 3D stimuli for the distinction
between representational and nonrepresentational stimuli. While these
dimensions are statistically related (e.g., 2D stimulus is more likely
to be a symbol than not), they are not logically related. There exist
both 2D stimuli that are not symbolic (e.g., CCTV feeds) and 3D stimuli
that are (e.g., toys). Thus, the only inference that can be drawn from
infants’ grasping of pictures is that they do not yet understand what
kind of thing 2D stimuli are, not that they do not understand symbols.
Second, the inference glosses over the fact that experience with a
representational medium might be necessary before engaging with it
appropriately. There is an apocryphal story about people running away
from the screen the first time they saw the short Lumière brothers’
movie depicting a train approaching a train station. It is unclear
whether this happened, but if it did, it would be absurd to conclude
that these adults lacked representational understanding. What they would
have lacked was knowledge about how the novel medium interacts with the
immediate environment. Coming back to infants, this surely is a body of
knowledge they must build over time, guided by adult scaffolding and
aided by ostensive signals that mark objects as symbols (Csibra &amp;
Shamsudheen, 2015; Mussavifard, 2023).</p>
<p>The earliest experimental evidence for the ability to represent
symbolic relations comes from a neuroimaging study with 5-month-old
infants by Kabdebon and Dehaene-Lambertz (2019). In this study, Kabdebon
and Dehaene-Lambertz tested whether infants can associate a picture to a
syllabic pattern (e.g., a cartoon fish to AAB-structured pseudo-words
such as “nonofe”, “gagalu”, “titina” versus a cartoon lion to
ABA-structured pseudo-words such as “rutaru”, “kemike”, “ladila”).
Electroencephalogram recordings revealed (i) that infants learned the
correct mappings from the abstract rule governing the pseudo-words to
the corresponding image (Experiment 1); (ii) that they could do so even
when one of the images is replaced by an arbitrary label (Experiment 2);
(iii) and that this mapping was not only predictive but
bidirectional-the effects held even when infants are tested on pairings
presented in the opposite order from familiarization (the image was
followed by the pseudo-words; Experiment 3). Kabdebon and
Dehaene-Lambertz interpreted these findings as supporting the early
emergence of cognitive operations that support symbolic relations-here,
the relation between a symbol picture and an abstract rule governing
syllabic structure.</p>
<p>While the study provides good evidence that infants represent
abstract syllable structures with internal mental symbols (otherwise, it
would not have been as easy to pair an external stimulus, such as a
picture, with a syllabic rule), the data cannot determine whether
infants interpreted the pictures themselves as symbols. In fact, two
other possibilities seem more likely. First, infants may have taken the
pseudo-words to be the symbols - and the pictures the referents - rather
than the other way around (Spelke, 2022). In this case, the study would
be silent on object symbols, because the symbols were, in fact,
linguistic ones. Second, infants may have interpreted both the
pseudo-words and the pictures as symbols (of an unspecified referent)
and learned the relations between them. In this case, the data would be
silent on the early emergence of STAND-FOR relations because the
relation between a symbol and its discourse referent would not have been
tested.</p>
<p>More convincing evidence of symbolic understanding starts to
accumulate only towards the end of infancy, from studies investigating
infants’ ability to learn words from pictures. These studies suggest
that infants learn quickly that some artifacts in their environment are
meant to stand for other entities (Ganea et al., 2009; Geraghty et al.,
2014; Preissler &amp; Carey, 2004). Preissler and Carey (2004) showed
line drawings of unfamiliar objects to 18-month-olds (e.g., whisks), and
taught them a novel label (e.g., “whisk”). Would infants infer that the
label applies to the drawing or to the type of object represented by the
drawings? To test this, infants were presented with the original drawing
and with a 3-D object and asked to pass the whisk. Most infants handed
either the object or both the object and drawing, but very rarely the
drawing alone (&lt;10%). These findings indicate that infants have
acquired a minimal distinction between symbols (whisk drawings) and
discourse referents (whisks) - a necessary condition for interpreting a
stimulus as a symbol.</p>
<p>At the same age at which they understand that a line drawing is
symbolic, infants have been argued to be unable to use replica toys in
the same way. In Experiment 1 by Tomasello and colleagues (1999), an
experimenter indicated to infants which object to choose from an array
(e.g., a hammer versus an apple) by holding up a toy version of that
object (e.g., a toy hammer). Eighteen-month-old infants were at chance
in this task, which has been interpreted as a developmental lag in the
ability to use objects as symbols. Note, however, that the task in
Preissler and Carey (2004) and the task in Tomassello and colleagues
(1999) differ not only in stimulus format-line drawings versus toy
replicas-but also in the relation between the symbol and the world. In
Preissler and Carey (2004), infants need not link the whisk drawing to
any real-world whisk. They could pass the task simply by assuming that,
all else equal, the whisk drawing represents a whisk-not necessarily a
real one-in an iconic way. Based on this assumption, they can infer how
actual whisks look like. In turn, this would allow them to choose a
whisk when prompted to give a “whisk”, even though the drawing does not
stand for any particular whisk.</p>
<p>By contrast, such a strategy is not available in Tomasello and
colleagues’ (1999) experiment. There, infants must anchor the symbol
stimulus - the toy hammer-to the real-world object in front of them-the
actual hammer. This mapping may be unavailable to infants, because a
symbol is by default linked to a discourse referent, which is not a
real-world object but an internally generated mental representation. In
the next section, I will review evidence that even toddlers struggle in
tasks that require them to link symbols to real objects. Note that this
is exactly analogous to the opening example of offside depicted with
bottles, where not even adults need automatically assume that the beer
bottles pick out a football player in the real world.</p>
<h2 id="object-symbols-in-early-childhood">OBJECT SYMBOLS IN EARLY
CHILDHOOD</h2>
<p>If the infant literature on STAND-FOR relations as conceived in the
current paper is sparse, the literature on early pretend play offers
plenty of insight into the links between symbols and discourse
referents. As object substitution pretense requires children to set up
precisely such relations, early competence in this domain implies the
early emergence of this capacity. Typically, a pretend play setup
involves toys or neutral objects and an adult experimenter who
stipulates pretend identities on props, gives children some information
about them, then prompts the children to act on the objects or
manipulates the objects herself according to simple scenarios.</p>
<p>By their second year of life, children choose the correct prop for
different pretense actions (Bosco et al., 2006; Harris &amp; Kavanaugh,
1993). If they are faced with a toy gorilla and a toy horse and with
orange and yellow blocks that they are told stand for carrots and
bananas, respectively, they will feed the two animals their preferred
food by choosing the appropriate blocks. Two-year-olds can also follow
predicated causal transformations undergone by the discourse referents
(not the symbols). They refrain, for instance, from using a banana block
if the gorilla has eaten it already, even though the block is still
physically present in the scene (Figure 2A).</p>
<p>The symbolic account explains children’s behavior in the scenario
depicted in Figure 2A as follows. The symbols are the available
perceptual objects: the toy gorilla and the yellow block. The
communicative experimental context prompts toddlers to treat them as
symbols of entities in the current universe of discourse. In the case of
the toy gorilla, toddlers can use a combination of iconic cues and
background knowledge about toys to infer that the toy must stand for a
gorilla. In the case of the yellow brick, toddlers use the
experimenter’s stipulation to establish that the yellow brick stands for
a banana. Once the two assignments are in place, toddlers, together with
the experimenter, can manipulate the objects to elaborate on the current
discourse. Thus, after being told that gorillas prefer bananas, toddlers
can easily accommodate this preference by selecting the corresponding
symbols-the yellow blocks-to enact a feeding event. At the same time,
they must continuously update their mental model of the current episode.
This allows them to register, for instance, that the banana represented
by one yellow brick has been eaten and is no longer available for a
second feeding event.</p>

<p>Note. Panel A: Schematic representation of Harris &amp; Kavanaugh
(1993, Experiment 2). After mapping the orange blocks to carrots, and
the yellow blocks to bananas, 2-year-olds perform pretend actions
according to preference: carrots to horses, bananas to gorillas. A block
is no longer a good candidate for feeding after having been used
already, even though it is still physically present in the scene. Panel
B: Schematic representation of Kavanaugh &amp; Harris (1994, Experiment
2). If the experimenter pretends that the gorilla spilled paint over the
horse and asks 2-year-olds how the horse looks now, they choose the
picture depicting the imaginary transformation.</p>
<!-- Media -->
<p>It is possible, of course, that children of this age take the
stipulated mappings as literal predications rather than STAND-FOR
relations (e.g., they believe the orange block is a carrot). However,
this does not seem to be the case, as young children keep
symbol-discourse referent assignments distinct across both discourses
and speakers (Andrasi et al., 2022; Harris &amp; Kavanaugh, 1993; Wyman
et al., 2009), suggesting that the relations created by the assignment
are discourse-specific and temporary. In addition, children rarely
confuse imaginary and actual events (Bourchier &amp; Davis, 2002;
Weisberg, 2015) and they do not think that pretend objects materialize
(Golomb &amp; Galasso, 1995; Woolley &amp; Phelps, 1994). This is nicely
explained by the two representational layers, postulated by the symbolic
account, which sharply distinguish the perceptual layer (the object
props) from the discourse layer (the entities the current episode is
about).</p>
<p>Moreover, 2-year-olds can select pictures representing the imaginary
transformations enacted by an experimenter. In one scenario (Figure 2B),
the experimenter pretended to spill red paint over the horse by tilting
an empty bucket over it. Children were then shown two pictures, one
depicting a toy horse identical to the one in front of them, the other
depicting a similar-looking horse that was colored red. When asked to
show how the horse looks now, toddlers pointed to the picture depicting
a red horse, ignoring the perceptual similarity between the other
picture and the toy horse in front of them (Harris et al., 1997;
Kavanaugh &amp; Harris, 1994). In other words, toddlers can answer
questions based on what is being predicated about the discourse
referents, which shows that the discourse-referent representation is
robust enough to override the appearance of the physical objects in
front of them.</p>
<p>Again, the symbolic account can explain this capacity without
difficulty. As in the banana-gorilla scenario, toddlers interpret both
the toy horse and the bucket as symbols of a horse and of a bucket,
respectively. Once the experimenter tilts the bucket over the horse,
toddlers infer that the bucket in this scenario contains paint. <span
class="math inline"><sup>3</sup></span> This prompts them to update
their internal model of the horse, which is now covered in paint. When
shown pictures depicting the imaginary transformations, toddlers select
the one that best represents their internal model of the horse.
Crucially, under this account, it is not the toy horse that is
attributed the property of being red but the horse that the toy stands
for. This makes it easy to follow pretend transformations, as toddlers
operate on a different mental representation from the one that keeps
track of the object in front of them.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>3</sup></span> This is arguably more
involved than the banana-gorilla scenario in Figure 2A,as toddlers must
infer from the tilting event that the bucket in the universe of
discourse contained some substance. This inference must rely, among
others, on world knowledge (how buckets are used) and potentially on
pragmatics (to explain why the experimenter performs the tilting
action), but how exactly the inference is achieved is beyond the scope
of this paper. However, the inference fits with the notion that object
symbols stand for discourse referents, while actions on the objects are
interpreted as predicates that ascribe properties to the discourse
referents. The inference is also analogous to the feeding event in the
banana-gorilla scenario in Figure 2A, in which toddlers interpret the
movement of a yellow block towards the mouth of the gorilla as signaling
that the corresponding banana has been eaten.</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<p>The claim that a bucket stands for a bucket may sound odd. After all,
object substitution pretense seems, by its very name, to imply the
substitution of one object by another. However, the symbolic account
does not involve substitutions but relations between symbols and
discourse referents. As a result, it can explain not only object
substitution but a wider variety of phenomena, and the requirement that
symbols and discourse referents do not coincide no longer applies. There
is nothing in the cognitive system dedicated to interpreting external
symbols that stops a symbol from standing for itself or for a token of
the same kind (e.g., actors playing themselves in a movie or a line
standing for a line in a drawing; for a similar argument, see Friedman,
2013; Leslie, 1994 for similar arguments), Nevertheless, in such cases,
there will still be two mental representations involved: one for the
symbol, one for the discourse referent. In sum, typical object
substitution pretense-in which the symbol and the discourse referent do
not coincide-is methodologically crucial, as it provides unambiguous
evidence that toddlers do not confuse the two. However, a distinction
between symbols and discourse referents is not necessary for the
category of object substitution pretense.</p>
<p>Finally, these experiments also reveal that children can generate
mental representations of discourse referents on their own. The
discourse referents that children keep track of are unrelated not only
to any immediate percept but to any percept whatsoever. In a typical
object substitution pretense (Figure 2A), there is no specific object
the props stand for: neither the toy horse nor the food morsels have
real-world counterparts. Thus, there is no preexisting mental
representation of a particular object the toddler can access when
keeping track of what is happening. Instead, she will need to create
these representations herself based on the experimenter’s
stipulations.</p>
<p>Early object substitution pretense thus suggests that the ability to
set up local relations between symbols and discourse referents emerges
early in development. Two-year-olds can temporarily assign a discourse
referent to a spatiotemporally trackable object, in a way that preserves
the distinction between the two. This is shown by the fact that
assignments are discarded when the pretense is over, so that the object
symbols can now stand for new discourse referents.</p>
<p>Glossed this way, pretend play becomes a variety of symbolic
communication, much like drawings, animations, and other media that rely
on the interface between object indexing and discourse referents.
Because of this, pretend play provides an excellent case study of
STAND-FOR relations. Unlike animations, for instance, where it is not
easy to determine whether toddlers interpret them as real events (but
see Revencu &amp; Csibra, 2021), pretend play experiments can test
whether toddlers mistake the symbols (the props) for the discourse
referents (the substituted identities), by varying the way in which
pretend objects are used across multiple contexts, for instance.</p>
<p>In sum, pretend play is not a standalone cognitive feat but a
manifestation of a cognitive subsystem that handles a broad class of
symbolic stimuli. While the parallels between pretend play and other
symbolic representations have been noted before (e.g., Gombrich, 1963;
Lillard et al., 2011; Piaget, 1962; Vygotsky, 2015; Walton, 1990),
existing cognitive accounts of pretend play have tended to overlook
them. I turn to these accounts next.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-accounts-of-pretend-play-and-symbols">Alternative
accounts of pretend play and symbols</h2>
<h2 id="the-decoupling-account">THE DECOUPLING ACCOUNT</h2>
<p>The first extended cognitive account of pretend play is the
decoupling model put forth by Leslie (1987). Leslie was the first to
point out that pretense shares critical features with the semantics of
mental-state verbs. Like BELIEVE, the PRETEND predicate also blocks
inference to the truth of the embedded propositions. One can thus
pretend (or believe) that this cup is empty (even though it is full),
that this cup is a seashell (even though it is not), or that there is a
second cup on the table (even though there is none). Based on this
parallelism, Leslie argued that toddlers should quarantine pretense
representations. This would avoid their representations about the world
becoming corrupted by pretense-induced misrepresentations. He assumed
that toddlers start a pretend play game with a primary mental
representation that accurately captures the perceived scene (e.g., “This
object is a banana”). They then create a copy of this primary
representation that is decoupled from its regular input-output relations
and that can be modified based on the pretend play stipulations (e.g.,
“This banana is a telephone”). This decoupling step ensures
quarantining, so toddlers will not leave the pretend play episode with
phony beliefs about bananas.</p>
<p>Subsequent theorists have added the claim that fictional propositions
should also be stored away from representations about the real world.
The behavioral account (Lillard, 2001; Nichols &amp; Stich, 2000)
postulated a Possible Worlds Box that separates pretend contents from
the rest of the cognitive system. A prominent evolutionary model
(Cosmides &amp; Tooby, 2000) argued for a system of scope tags that
travel along with representations and block upward inference
accordingly. Regardless of implementation, there has been widespread
agreement that pretend representations must be stored separately from
reality representations (Lillard, 2001; Weisberg, 2015; Wyman et al.,
2009).</p>
<p>However, decoupling and quarantining may not be needed to account for
object substitution pretense, at least not without further
qualification. But before going into this discussion, two often
overlooked distinctions ought to be highlighted. On the one hand, we
must distinguish symbols from discourse referents (e.g., bananas from
phones); on the other hand, we must distinguish tokens from types (e.g.,
this banana from bananas in general). As these two dimensions are
orthogonal, this yields four distinct ways in which quarantining can
interact with pretend play. In the context of the object symbols,
children should learn neither that bananas are phones (type-level
information related to the object symbol) nor that this banana is a
phone (token-level information about the object symbol). As for the
discourse referents, children should not learn anything about the phone
that the banana stands for, because this phone does not exist
(token-level information about the discourse referent). However, they
should learn new facts about phones in general (e.g., that one can talk
into them: type-level information related to the discourse referent).
Thus, the desirability of quarantining is not uniform across the four
combinations.</p>
<p>Let us first consider quarantining at the level of the symbol type.
To guard against a type-level false belief, Nichols &amp; Stich (2000)
noted that children might keep the ontology of bananas and phones
straight not by decoupling but by not categorizing the prop as a banana
in the first place. If the prop is not categorized as a banana to begin
with, children will not come to believe that bananas are phones.
Moreover, if pretending that the banana is a phone involves a decoupled
representation with the content “the banana is a phone”, whatever
predicates are ascribed to the phone will be attributed to an object
that is a banana as well. But it does not make sense for a banana to be
used to call anybody, even when under the scope of pretense. This
predicate only applies to the phone that the banana currently stands
for.</p>
<p>At the token level, though, it has been argued that children may come
to falsely believe that this (object) is a phone, even if they do not
represent it as a banana. But is it the case that a representation with
the content “this is a phone” is necessary when pretending that the
banana is a phone? In language, it is evident that words are not their
referents, so it would be absurd to posit a quarantined representation
with the content ” banana’ = banana”. For visual representations such as
graphs or maps, this analysis does not make much sense either. When
consulting a map, humans do not suppose that a circle is a subway
station; it merely stands for one. Analogously, in pretense, props are
used as symbols, to convey information about discourse referents.
Therefore, the relations one sets up in pretense need not involve the
IS-A predicate at all. In other words, the assignment from the symbol
objects to the discourse referent is an instance of STAND-FOR
stipulation, not of kind membership predication. And because the object
symbol only stands for the discourse referent, the proposition “this
banana/prop is a phone” will never be entertained.</p>
<p>That symbol-referent links are orthogonal to how the discourse
referent layer relates to the world can be illustrated with an example.
When pretending that a banana is a phone, one creates a toy fictional
world in which there is a phone. However, it is not the case in this
fictional world that the banana is a phone. In fact, the banana is not
part of this world at all. There are thus two aspects of this setup that
could undergo quarantining in principle, and they are independent from
each other. On the one hand, one should decouple the banana-phone link.
As we have seen, however, if the banana is a local symbol of a phone,
quarantining is unnecessary. On the other, one should decouple the toy
fictional world to which the phone belongs from reality, as the phone
does not exist in the world.</p>
<p>However, this brings us outside the boundaries of pretense, because
the same problems arise for any communicative act. The parallels between
pretend play and communication have been noted before (e.g., Friedman,
2013; Leslie &amp; Happé, 1989), but the cognitive implications this
parallelism has for quarantining have not been fully spelled out, to my
knowledge. Humans use props to depict specific events (how Brutus killed
Caesar), generic states of affairs (how corkscrews work), or fictional
content (how Batman killed Joker, how dragons look like). If the content
holds only in a fictional world, quarantining might be needed to mark
the content as not true. But in this case, there is no need to posit a
quarantining operation specific to pretense, because the same problem
arises for language, which can be used to talk about anything, factual
or fictional. In this respect, pretend play is equivalent to
storytelling or puppet shows. In all these cases, children face the
readers’ dilemma (Gerrig &amp; Prentice, 1991): they must distinguish
the information that must be quarantined from information that should be
stored long-term because it is about the world (for a review, see
Hopkins &amp; Weisberg, 2017). How children solve this problem goes
beyond the scope of the present account, as it spans not only the use of
objects as symbols but language as well. However children solve this
problem, though, the solution they converge upon in pretense should be
the same as for any communicative act.</p>
<p>Then again, the necessity of decoupling fictional content rests on
the tacit assumption that the default propositional attitude to mental
representations extracted from the world is belief. If toddlers encode
the contents of pretense as beliefs, the propositions conveyed in a
pretend-play episode must be decoupled, lest they contaminate children’s
beliefs with false contents. But toddlers may not automatically enter a
belief-relation to the mental representations they create based on the
external representations they interpret. If the contents of external
representations are not in danger of being encoded as beliefs, there is
no need for an additional decoupling operation. When it comes to the
discourse referents, for instance, this might be the default
interpretation. Just as in the typical fairy tale opening (“Once upon a
time, there was a king…”), children confronted with the proverbial
banana-phone scenario must conjure up the phone that the banana stands
for internally, as a concept token. Consequently, the internal ‘phone’
representation will be spatiotemporally undefined with respect to the
real world. This does not imply that 18-month-olds already possess a
concept of FICTION that could use to tag the discourse referents as
such. Rather, the internal generation of the ‘phone’
representation-instead of retrieving a representation of a real
phone-amounts to an implicit tagging of the phone as fictional. If this
is true, the mental representations children would use to encode pretend
play scenarios would be decoupled by default. In contrast to the
decoupling account, what children would need to learn is how to couple
representations to the world. I will present evidence for this
intriguing possibility in the next subsection.</p>
<p>In any case, one must not lump together the structure of pretense (an
object symbol stands for a discourse referent) with the ontological
status of the discourse referent, failing to discriminate format and
content. If these are indeed two orthogonal issues, children should be
able to learn from pretense despite the alleged need to quarantine.
While there is not much data regarding toddlers’ learning from pretense,
recent studies have shown that preschoolers learn generic information
from pretense (Baer &amp; Friedman, 2016; Hopkins et al., 2015;
Sutherland &amp; Friedman, 2012). In these studies, an experimenter used
pretend-like props to teach 3-5-year-old children new facts about a
known category (e.g., that dogs are afraid of raccoons) or about an
invented one (e.g., that “nerps” like apples). Children extended what
they learned to new exemplars but not to the props used during learning.
In addition, if a speaker who did not witness the pretense stipulation
asked for the new category, they did not even consider the props as good
candidates to offer to the new speaker, indicating that symbol-referent
assignments are local (and thus automatically quarantined). When
children were encouraged by one experimenter to pretend that
screwdrivers are “sprocks”, they were less likely to give a screwdriver
to a second experimenter when she asked them for a “sprock” (Hopkins et
al., 2015). Instead, they handed a novel object, presumably the one they
took to be the actual sprock. Preschoolers can thus learn new facts
about the world from object substitution pretense, as expected if
pretend play is a subspecies of human communication.</p>
<p>In sum, the consensus surrounding the need for quarantining the
mental representations involved in pretend play relies on the conflation
of two distinctions (type vs. token; symbol vs. discourse referent) and
on the assumption that IS-A relations are the only way to link props to
referents. <span class="math inline"><sup>4</sup></span> But if children
have access to STAND-FOR relations too,the need for decoupling
disappears - at least when it comes to the format of object substitution
pretense. As for content, positing indiscriminate quarantining and
decoupling leads to wrong predictions. Preschoolers should not be able
to learn generic information about the world if they quarantine the
pretend episode indiscriminately STAND-FOR, but they are.</p>
<p>Taking a step back from pretense, consider once again the offside
example in the Introduction. While the bottles do not pick out any
particular football player, the representation as a whole can be used to
teach a piece of real-world knowledge: what offside is in European
football. Thus, the relation between what a representation depicts and
what it is rational to learn from it is not as straightforward as to
allow us to discern what should-and what should not-be quarantined.
Finally, quarantining and decoupling may not be needed as cognitive
operations to keep track that the pretend episode is about fictional
entities, since external representations may not be related to the real
world by default. In the next subsection, I offer an interpretation of
children’s seeming failure to understand pictures, videos, and scale
models along these very lines and broaden the discussion by considering
other representational media.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>4</sup></span> This assumption may be
prevalent because in everyday language,STAND-FOR relations are often
unmarked. For instance, one can point to a bottle on the table and say,
“This is the goalkeeper”.</p>

<h2 id="the-dual-representation-account">THE DUAL-REPRESENTATION
ACCOUNT</h2>
<p>Infants and toddlers, including those who already engage in pretend
play, are usually not credited with understanding nonlinguistic
representations (e.g., DeLoache, 2004; Perner, 1991). In this section, I
will discuss several reasons that underlie this skepticism and argue
that they are not wellfounded. I will revisit the data on how infants
and young toddlers deal with visual representations in the lab as well
as several explanations that have been put forth to account for the
discrepancy between interpreting and using representations.</p>
<p>The studies assessing young children’s understanding of visual
representations typically employed object-retrieval tasks. In these
tasks, children have to retrieve a hidden toy based on information
obtained from pictures, videos, or scale models (DeLoache, 1991;
DeLoache &amp; Burns, 1994; Troseth &amp; DeLoache, 1998). The results
from these studies seem to point to a slow developmental trajectory of
representational understanding: it is not before the age of three that
children reliably pass the object-retrieval tasks. As an explanation for
this developmental lag, DeLoache (2004) suggested that the problem stems
from the dual representation challenge that nonlinguistic symbols give
rise to: they stand for objects while being objects themselves. Thus,
according to DeLoache (2004), young children’s executive function is not
yet mature enough to allow them to represent a symbol as an object and
as its referent at the same time.</p>
<p>As we have seen, however, toddlers who fail DeLoache-type tasks do
not encounter any dual-representation problem when engaging in pretend
play, even though the representational requirements are analogous:
objects that stand for something else while being objects themselves.
Thus, 2-year-olds’ failure to retrieve an object from information
received via an external representation cannot be attributed to a
problem they have already overcome.</p>
<p>DeLoache (1991) also noted this tension and highlighted several
differences between pretend play and the object-retrieval tasks cited
above. For instance, scale models-unlike pretense-require toddlers to
conceive of the prop in two different ways at the same time, both as an
object and as a symbol. However, 2-year-olds fail even in tasks that do
not pose this requirement. In DeLoache and Burns (1994), the hidden toy
could be hidden in one of four locations, indexed by different pieces of
furniture. The experimenter revealed the toy’s location by pointing to
one of four pictures, each of which depicted one of the distinct
furniture items in the adjacent room. Note that this does not require
toddlers to conceive of the pictures as objects in themselves; merely
using them as pointers to the real furniture items would have sufficed.
However, 2-year-olds’ performance was poor in this task as well.
Therefore, the alleged inability to simultaneously grasp both aspects of
a symbol cannot provide a complete explanation for toddlers’
failures.</p>
<p>Another feature distinguishing DeLoache’s tasks from object
substitution pretense is their relation to the world. Her tasks require
children to link the information they obtain via pictures, videos, or
scale models to a specific state of affairs that holds in the here and
now. However, this need not be the only way representations are
interpreted - not even the default one. It is possible that
understanding representations of real-world situations requires an
additional step of linking the discourse referent layer to actual
objects and events, which may go beyond 2-year-olds’ cognitive
repertoire. This can occur because children must learn that external
representations can be used to inform about a particular state of
affairs, because there is an additional relation that needs to be
computed (discourse referents-world), or both.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario in which a child pretending together with an
adult that a banana is a phone is, all of a sudden, asked by the adult
to go fetch the phone. The child will be dumbfounded, as she has not
assumed that there is a phone out there in the world that the banana
refers to. If this is the default interpretation, it might take children
time to learn that representations can also be coupled to actual states
of affairs. Alternatively, the additional step of linking a
representation to the real world may tax the child’s cognitive
resources. This possibility is supported by the prevalence of
perseveration errors in DeLoache’s tasks. Suddendorf (2003) replicated
2-year-olds’ failure across several trials in the retrieval task found
by DeLoache but noticed that they retrieved the object above chance on
the first trial. Hypothesizing that performance on later trials may be
impeded because children go back to the location from the first trial,
Suddendorf (2003) modified the paradigm and introduced separate target
rooms for each trial. Consistent with the hypothesis, 2-year-olds were
above chance in their average responses when the target room changed on
each trial. However, a different pattern of results was obtained by
DeLoache and Burns (1994), where there was no difference between earlier
and later trials in 2-year-olds’ performance on an object-retrieval task
with pictures. In any case, whichever of these possibilities-modifying
the default uncoupled interpretation versus a lack of executive
resources for overcoming the answer on the first trial-turns out to be
correct, neither implies a failure to understand representations.</p>
<h2 id="the-functional-play-account">THE FUNCTIONAL-PLAY ACCOUNT</h2>
<p>Another potential reason for denying toddlers early symbolic
abilities rests on the well-established finding that children find it
easier to pretend when props are similar to their referents (Bigham
&amp; Bourchier-Sutton, 2007; Elder &amp; Pederson, 1978; Fein, 1975;
Hopkins et al., 2016; Jackowitz &amp; Watson, 1980). A toy phone is
easiest for toddlers to pretend that it is a phone, followed by objects
with similar form (a banana) or function (a walkie-talkie), and finally
by objects with dissimilar form and function (a wooden block or a toy
car). Based on these findings, it has been argued that young children’s
mental representations are not abstract enough to ignore the similarity
of the substitute object, and hence that early play is not symbolic but
functional (Baron-Cohen, 1987). According to this line of reasoning,
children treat toys as small but real objects (e.g., a toy phone is a
kind of phone), not as symbolic ones.</p>
<p>There are at least three reasons to doubt this interpretation of the
similarity effect. First, while children find pretend scenarios with
dissimilar objects difficult, this difficulty is relative, not absolute.
Whether measured by production (Elder &amp; Pederson, 1978; Fein, 1975;
Jackowitz &amp; Watson, 1980) or comprehension (Bigham &amp;
Bourchier-Sutton, 2007; Hopkins et al., 2016), children as a group are
above chance in the pretense task even in the dissimilar-object
conditions. <span class="math inline"><sup>5</sup></span> This is not to
deny or explain away the variation in children’s performance as a
function of object similarity. However, the fact that children can do it
at all must be explained as well, and the symbolic account is
well-equipped to do this.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>5</sup></span> The only condition in
which no 16-month-old participant produced any pretend action is the
imaginary-object condition of Jackowitz &amp; Watson (1980), in which
the experimenter pretended to put an object on the table (by holding her
hand as if she held an object). Sixteen-month-old infants were then
asked to “pretend to talk on the</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<p>The second reason is related to the fact that the symbolic account I
am defending can account for the similarity effect as well. Under this
account, the distinction between iconic and arbitrary signs is
downplayed. Instead, any object that can be tracked in space to gather
information about its discourse referent is a symbol, whether the
discourse referent is conveyed by linguistic stipulation (e.g., “Let’s
pretend this block is a banana”), by its features (e.g., a toy banana
looks like a banana), or by the way it is used (e.g., bringing a banana
to the ear can convey that it now stands for a phone). The tasks that
report evidence against a symbolic understanding of pretense pit the
prop’s visual (or functional) features against the experimenter’s
actions (e.g., the experimenter uses a plastic apple as a hammer: Elder
&amp; Pederson, 1978). But if children use both cues to establish what
an object stands for, it follows that dissimilar-object trials, where
there is a mismatch, will be more difficult than similar-object ones,
where there is none. Under this account, it is expected, for instance,
that it will be more difficult to pretend that a toy car is a phone,
because the child also receives visual information that the toy car
should stand for a car. It might thus take time for children to converge
on the proper weights for each of these cues. In addition, even adults
show a preference for iconic props in pretense (Qian &amp; Ullman,
2024), even though their symbolic capacities are well in place.</p>
<p>The third reason also takes this cue mismatch into account but
ascribes the difficulty not to the mismatch itself but to the pragmatics
of the experimental setup. The tasks that find an effect of object
similarity (e.g., Fein, 1975; Hopkins et al., 2016) start with
familiarization trials, which introduce children to the objects they
will later have to replace by other props. This might make the task
pragmatically infelicitous: why would the experimenter replace a good
phone symbol (e.g., a toy phone) with a worse one (e.g., a car)? If this
seems far-fetched, consider a study showing that 15-month-old infants
can pass a comprehension task even in a dissimilar-object condition
(Onishi et al., 2007). Onishi and colleagues tested whether infants
expect sequences of pretend scenarios to be congruent with their
background knowledge. In the dissimilar-object condition, infants were
exposed to an adult pretending to pour a liquid from an empty jug into
one of two shoes. On congruent trials, the adult then proceeded to
pretend-drink from the same shoe. On incongruent trials, the adult
pretended to drink from the other shoe. Infants looked longer on
incongruent trials but only if they received extensive evidence
beforehand that the shoe is (a symbol of) a cup (Onishi et al., 2007,
Experiment 3). Notably, infants in this study did not receive any
familiarization with cups. This may have made the task less
pragmatically odd and thus easier for infants.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p>phone”. Infants’ complete failure in this task is not incompatible
with the symbolic account, which postulates that indexes are assigned to
objects to allow for spatiotemporal tracking. It may be that the ability
to assign indexes to imaginary objects in empty space takes more time to
develop.</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<p>A related argument against the symbolic account is that children seem
to produce pretense actions before they comprehend them in others. This
would distinguish the development of pretense from the acquisition of
other symbol systems, such as language, where comprehension typically
precedes production (e.g., Bergelson &amp; Swingley, 2012; E. Clark
&amp; Hecht, 1983; Perkins &amp; Lidz, 2021; Pomiechowska et al., 2024).
The claim that children produce object substitution pretense actions
before they understand them is inspired by an intriguing developmental
difference observed across labs. On the one hand, Elder and Pederson
(1978) report that 3%-year-olds are at ceiling in a task that requires
them to produce a pretend action (e.g., combing) with a dissimilar
object (e.g., a flat piece of wood). On the other hand, Bigham and
Bourchier-Sutton (2007) report that children in the same age group are
still struggling in a task that requires them to recognize the same
pretend action when the experimenter performs it with a dissimilar
object.</p>
<p>Hopkins and colleagues (2016) provided a direct test of this
cross-lab finding by comparing age-matched 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old
children in a production versus a comprehension condition. In the
production condition, children were asked to pretend to perform an
action (e.g., writing) with objects varying in similarity to the object
typically used to perform that action (e.g., a marker, a drumstick, or a
padlock). The action was explicitly labeled by the experimenter (e.g.,
“Pretend that you are writing with this”). The comprehension condition
was identical, except that the experimenter pretended to perform the
same action with the same objects, then asked the child what they are
pretending to do. Consistent with the cross-lab result on which the
experiment was based, Hopkins and colleagues (2016) found that children
were at ceiling in the production condition with all prop types and at
all ages. By contrast, children in the comprehension condition were at
ceiling only with the objects that were similar to the objects they
substituted, regardless of age.</p>
<p>Hopkins and colleagues (2016) interpret this as evidence that, unlike
in language acquisition, production precedes comprehension in pretend
play. However, there is a simpler explanation that bypasses the need of
postulating a production-precedes-comprehension trajectory: inverse
problems, which require selecting the right hypothesis given some data,
are harder than forward problems, which require generating a set of data
from a given hypothesis. Imagine having to pantomime a police officer,
for instance. The solution will come quickly to mind: you need a way to
convey what is typical of police officers (e.g., uniform, whistle,
orchestrating traffic, etc.). Imagine, on the other hand, having to
guess that someone else is pantomiming a police officer. This is a
harder task, as all the gestures the mime will do (e.g., for the
uniform, whistle, or traffic orchestration) will be ambiguous, both in
isolation (e.g., is it a uniform or a costume?) and taken together
(e.g., is it a police officer orchestrating traffic, or a referee
calling a foul?).</p>
<p>Experimental evidence confirms this intuition. Adults find it easy to
pantomime familiar objects but hard to guess the pantomimed object of
others (van Nispen et al., 2017). This is not because production is, all
else equal, more difficult than comprehension: When adults in the
comprehension condition are given a forced-choice task, which massively
reduces the hypothesis space, they are at ceiling in the comprehension
task as well. I expect a similar boost in children’s scores if the
open-ended task is replaced with a forced-choice one. In addition, the
study by Onishi and colleagues (2007) reviewed above also indicates that
comprehension is available to 15-month-old infants, who recognize
pretense in others with dissimilar objects (e.g., pretend-drinking from
a shoe). However, they do need more extensive evidence that the
dissimilar object is used as such (Onishi et al., 2007).</p>
<p>Thus, the emergence of production before comprehension is likely a
by-product of the tasks used to measure it. This finding holds for both
children and adults and is due to the large hypothesis spaces that
comprehension tasks carry. Indeed, if the symbolic account is true,
comprehension should precede production, as in language development,
simply because production requires more steps (e.g., planning, memory,
motor action) than comprehension.</p>
<h2 id="the-conceptual-deficit-account">THE CONCEPTUAL-DEFICIT
ACCOUNT</h2>
<p>Alternatively, one could reject the claim that all the phenomena
under discussion involve representational understanding, from object
substitution pretense to DeLoache’s object retrieval tasks. This is the
path taken, for instance, in Perner (1991). According to this position,
pretend play is not evidence of symbolic understanding, as one cannot
attribute a cognitive system with understanding representations unless
the representational relation between the medium and the content is
itself represented. As young children do not possess this capacity yet,
it is argued that a behavioral account can explain the data equally
well. According to this account, infants do not understand the banana as
a symbol for a phone but create a separate representation with the
content “the banana is a phone” and act as if the decoupled
representation were accurate.</p>
<p>It is not clear why being able to think about the contents of a
mental representation should be taken to be the litmus test for
attributing a cognitive capacity to an organism-depth perception does
not require an explicit representation of depth. Analogously, STAND-FOR
relations may be embedded in human cognition without being explicitly
represented by a standalone concept. Under the account defended here,
toddlers possess a cognitive mechanism that can (i) relate a
perceptually available object <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> (a banana) to a discourse referent
<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> (a phone); and (ii)
interpret the actions performed by another person on the object <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> predicatively,as properties or
events involving the discourse referent <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> . This allows them to acquire or
convey information about the discourse referents based on the
perceptually available symbols without needing an explicit
SYMBOL/REPRESENTATION concept.</p>
<p>Thus, while Perner (1991) is right to point out that an explicit
SYMBOL/REPRESENTATION concept is missing in early development, singling
out the behavioral as-if account as the only alternative poses a false
dilemma. Explicit understanding and behavioral interpretation are not
the only options. The inadequacy of this move is highlighted by the
comparison to language, where an analogous developmental procession
occurs: interpreting words as symbols and sentences as representations
precedes metalinguistic awareness (Doherty &amp; Perner, 1998). However,
there is no reason to postulate a behavioral as-if account for early
language understanding. Even if toddlers cannot yet entertain thoughts
about symbol-referent relations between the word “bunny” and a bunny,
this implies neither that they are unable to represent and exploit these
relations in communication (for a review, see Luchkina &amp; Waxman,
2021), nor that they interpret “bunny” as if it were a bunny.</p>
<p>Moreover, the behavioral as-if account of pretend play lacks
generality, since it does not fare well for other representational
media. Suppose the legend of a graph stipulates that the circle on the
graph represents the mean of a numerical distribution. In this case,
there is no easy way to construe an interpretation under the as-if
account: what would it mean to behave as if the circle were the
mean?</p>
<p>Finally, the behavioral account has several other drawbacks, which
have been rightly noted by Friedman and Leslie (2007). First, the
account creates a double-edged sword for itself regarding pretense
recognition. On the one hand, children driven by the perceptual
similarity between actions will have difficulty distinguishing actual
from as-if behavior. One might be tempted to invoke ostensive manner
cues (e.g., smiling or exaggerated motion) as a guide to the
distinction, but the behavioral account does not have this option.
Manner cues will necessarily match the behavior to a lesser degree
(e.g., smiling when pretending that the banana is a phone is not
necessarily what one does when holding an actual phone), so pretense
recognition should be hindered in these situations instead of boosted.
Second, pretense based on sound effects should not occur. A child
observing an adult moving a pencil on the table while saying “vroom,
vroom” could not interpret the pencil as a car because this is not what
one would do if the pencil were a car. The same holds for pretend
speech: an adult manipulating a teddy bear while speaking on its behalf
does not behave as if the teddy were an actual bear or person.</p>
<p>While pretend sounds and speech do not invalidate the symbolic
account I am defending, the model does need an extension to accommodate
them. To understand pretend sounds and speech, children must update the
information about the discourse referent based not only on the
corresponding object symbol but also on the adult’s sounds or
utterances. For instance, when the adult yawns or utters “I am tired”
while wiggling a teddy bear, children must ascribe the predicate TIRED
to the bear represented by the teddy. This introduces an additional
challenge, as children must now distinguish between utterances that are
about the game (e.g., “Let’s pretend this is a phone”) from utterances
that are part of the game (e.g., “Ring! Ring!”). How children overcome
this challenge is highly intriguing but lies beyond the scope of the
current discussion. First, as in the case of role play (Thompson &amp;
Goldstein, 2019), there is no evidence that understanding pretend sounds
and speech emerges together with object substitution pretense-the
earliest such evidence comes from 2%-year-olds, at least 6 months after
object substitution is in place (Friedman et al., 2010). Second, the
basic requirement posed by object substitution pretense continues to
hold for pretend sounds and speech, as toddlers must still represent the
STAND-FOR relation between an object symbol and its discourse referent.
<span class="math inline"><sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p>Two more arguments against the symbolic account of pretense pursued
in Perner (1991) rest on toddlers’ seeming failure to understand that a
single representation can have multiple meanings and that
representations can misrepresent. The multiple-meanings requirement is
ambiguous between two readings, depending on whether the multiple
meanings ought to be active sequentially or simultaneously. On the
sequential reading, toddlers should not be able to assign multiple
meanings to a single symbol across time, but they are. Two- and
three-year-olds have no issues using props as stand-ins for different
entities across discourses (Harris &amp; Kavanaugh, 1993; Wyman et al.,
2009).</p>
<p>On the simultaneous reading, toddlers should understand not only that
a symbol not has a meaning currently but also that it might have meant
something else. Here, again the analogy with language can help. It takes
time for children to learn what type of things words are (Doherty &amp;
Perner, 1998), but this does not imply that children do interpret words
as if they were their referent. Moreover, children at this age seem to
sample one answer from a distribution instead of simultaneously
entertaining multiple possibilities (Leahy &amp; Carey, 2020). Hence,
they might not be able to reason about the potential other meanings of a
representation for unrelated reasons. In short, the arguments against
treating pretend play as evidence of representational understanding
convincingly show that children lack metacognitive access to their
cognitive processes, but not that these cognitive processes are not
already in place.</p>
<p>As for misrepresentation, it may well be true that children realize
only later that representations can misrepresent. This, however, might
occur not because they do not understand representations but because the
discourse referent layer (i.e., the content of the representation) is
not linked to any real-world state of affairs. Because of this,
representations cannot misrepresent by definition.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>6</sup></span> If they do not,they
would not be able to link the adult’s sounds and speech to the
appropriate discourse referent. This is also why adults need to
manipulate the relevant object symbols (e.g., move the pencil across the
table or wiggle the teddy) when engaging in pretend sounds or speech: to
signal, via the object symbol, which referent the sounds or speech
should be attributed to.</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<p>Finally, some researchers have adopted a midway position and argued
that while pretend play is not merely as-if behavior (Rakoczy et al.,
2005), toddlers’ capacities are not yet fully symbolic because, at this
stage, pretense amounts to symbolizing a kind property (e.g., banana
symbolizes phoneness), instead of linking a symbol to a referent (Csibra
&amp; Shamsudheen, 2015; Rakoczy et al., 2005). This claim is
problematic for two reasons. First, it predicts that toddlers will not
be able to understand scenarios in which two different symbols stand for
the same type of thing. Consider a scenario in which the child uses a
banana as a phone to pretend-speak with an adult, who also uses a
(different) banana as a different phone. If children take the banana to
represent a kind property, they will not be able to distinguish between
the referent of the two bananas: both bananas will just mean PHONE.
Kinds, in other words, are not suited for the individuation required in
this case; only tokens are (Brody, 2020). In addition, toddlers would
not be able understand a variety of predicates that can only be applied
to tokens. It is only a phone token-not the phone kind - that can be
moved to the ear and spoken into. Experimental data confirms that
toddlers take the props to stand for tokens, not kinds (Harris &amp;
Kavanaugh, 1993, Experiment 2). When pretending that a yellow block is a
banana that has been fed to a toy gorilla (Figure 2A), infants refrain
from offering the same yellow block to the gorilla a second time and opt
for a different yellow block instead. This shows that toddlers do not
assume the yellow blocks stand for the BANANA kind. Else, they would
have neither distinguished between multiple blocks nor ascribed the
token-level property of having been eaten to any of them.</p>
<h2 id="the-analogy-account">THE ANALOGY ACCOUNT</h2>
<p>Another account that denies early symbolic capacities to toddlers
proposes analogical reasoning as the cognitive engine underlying object
substitution pretense (Fein, 1975; Rabkina &amp; Forbus, 2022). Drawing
on the structure-mapping theory of analogy (Gentner, 1983), the account
proposes that object substitution pretense is driven by a structural
alignment between the literal scenario (the actions performed on the
props) and the imagined scenario (the actions enacted by means of the
props). As Rabkina and Forbus (2022) note, one virtue of the analogy
account is the straightforward explanation it offers for why children
find it easier to pretend with props that resemble their referents: the
higher the similarity, the fewer mappings are needed from the literal to
the imagined scenarios and the lower the processing costs.</p>
<p>Although Rabkina and Forbus (2022) do not discuss object substitution
pretense in the context of depictions broadly construed, analogical
reasoning might be responsible for interpreting the content of
depictions as well. Indeed, in the offside example illustrated in Figure
1, successful interpretation requires the audience to establish a
mapping between two sets of relations-the spatial relations among the
bottles and the spatial relations among the players. This is precisely
where analogical reasoning excels.</p>
<p>There are, however, reasons to doubt that an analogy account can
successfully cover the entire spectrum of depictions. In analogical
reasoning, two mental representations are aligned, and the structural
relations among the objects in the source representation are mapped onto
the relations among the objects in the target representation (1983).
Importantly, any kind of relation in the source domain can be projected
onto the target domain, while the sets of relations projected from
source to target are,by definition,identical (e.g.,the relation
REVOLVE-AROUND(x,y)applies to both the Earth and the sun and the
electron and nucleus in the atom-solar system analogy). Neither
condition holds for depictions. First, depictions convey their message
primarily through spatial relations holding between the objects in the
here and now. Second, spatial relations in depictions need not convey
spatial information at all. For instance, in a diagram depicting the
social relations in a group of primates, the relative positions of the
diagram elements on the vertical axis can encode dominance relations.
This breaks the requirement that relations are constant across source
and target, as spatial relations can convey information about nonspatial
ones.</p>
<p>The same analysis holds for object substitution pretense. In
pretense, spatial relations and trajectories are used to enact imagined
events, but they need not convey spatial information. In Harris and
Kavanaugh (1993), the relation EAT(gorilla, banana) is conveyed by
simply moving the yellow block towards the mouth of the toy gorilla, but
there is no corresponding eating event in the literal scenario. (Indeed,
there could not be, as toy gorillas do not eat.) As for the finding that
children find it easier to pretend with similar props, I have already
noted that the symbolic account explains this similarity effect by
noting that there are different ways one can convey what type of entity
a prop stands for-iconicity, use, and linguistic stipulation- and that
ease should increase proportionally to the degree of convergence between
these different cues.</p>
<p>Analogy may, however, play a role when toddlers extrapolate a
stipulation that has been performed on one type of prop to other props
of the same kind. In the experiment by Harris and Kavanaugh (1993)
depicted in Figure 2A, one yellow brick was labeled by an experimenter
as a “banana”. Based on this stipulation, toddlers spontaneously
inferred that other yellow bricks would, all else equal, stand for
bananas as well, even though they were not labeled as such. Such
inferences may be driven by an analogical process that maps the relation
SAME KIND holding between the yellow bricks to the relation holding
between the discourse referents. This analogy would provide the basis
for the inference that all discourse referents the yellow bricks stand
for are bananas too.</p>
<p>In short, analogical reasoning does not entirely cover humans’
interpretation of scenes using objects as symbols, including pretend
play, because not all relations are created equal-spatial relations are
privileged-and because the two sets of relations need not be of the same
type-spatial relations can convey information about nonspatial ones.</p>
<h2 id="the-linguistic-account">THE LINGUISTIC ACCOUNT</h2>
<p>Even when toddlers interpreting drawings or engaging in pretend play
have been granted some degree symbolic understanding, it has been denied
that the underlying capacity could be a primitive of the cognitive
system (e.g., Rakoczy et al., 2005; Spelke, 2022).</p>
<p>Rakoczy et al. (2005) offer a cultural learning account for
understanding representations built around shared enculturation,
intentionality, and language learning. While a child’s surrounding
environment should play a role in dictating which types of stimuli are
to be used and interpreted as representations, it is not clear how it
could create a cognitive system from scratch. I will thus focus on the
cognitive preconditions for interpreting objects as symbols that Rakoczy
et al. (2005) put forth.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Rakoczy et al. (2005) argue that understanding
intentions must precede understanding symbols because symbolic objects
have meaning only by virtue of their user’s intentions. While a thorough
examination of the connection between symbol understanding and intention
attribution goes beyond the scope of the present paper, two points are
worth highlighting.</p>
<p>First, Rakoczy and colleagues’ observation is probably true as a
metaphysical statement. However, metaphysics and psychology need not
overlap, so the move from metaphysics to psychology cannot be made
without further argument. While it is true that mass is a necessary
condition for objecthood (as intentions may be for symbols), it does not
follow that mass needs to be represented when reasoning about mid-sized
objects, as indeed it is not (Spelke, 1990, 2022) Second, a
self-consistent psychological account of interpreting communication as a
type of action without resorting to intention ascription is both
possible and developmentally plausible (Mussavifard, 2023). If
interpreting external symbols only requires establishing links between
an object layer and a discourse referent layer, attributing intentions
to the communicator will be superfluous, at least on some occasions.
What will matter is figuring out which stimuli in the environment are to
be interpreted this way, for which ostensive signals and adult
scaffolding should play a significant role (Csibra, 2010; Lillard &amp;
Witherington, 2004).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rakoczy et al. (2005) consider language a
precondition for understanding objects as symbols. The central argument
hinges on the fact that symbols must always be brought under some
description when interpreted. While this may be true, the necessity of
natural language follows only if one denies preverbal infants the
ability to generate such descriptions some other way. And there are at
least two ways that bypass natural language. First, preverbal infants
might possess a language of thought - an internal, open-ended, and
language-like system that combines primitive units into arbitrarily
complex expressions (Fodor, 1975). An innate language of thought would
render natural language unnecessary because such a language could
generate the conceptual descriptions itself. Second, concepts in core
systems could be enough for the referents to be brought under a
description (e.g., AGENT, OBJECT) even in the absence of a language of
thought. <span class="math inline"><sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p>Finally, Rakoczy et al. (2005) draw on training studies to argue that
language plays a crucial role in the development of pretense. In one
such study (Rakoczy et al., 2006), children exposed to pretense-specific
language (e.g., “I pretend that this stone is an apple, but really it is
a stone”) outperformed a control group exposed to pretense without such
language. This evidence is used to argue that language also plays a
causal role outside the lab. But if “causal” means “necessary”, no such
conclusion follows: words facilitate category formation (Waxman &amp;
Markow, 1995) without being necessary for category formation (Murphy,
2024).</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>7</sup></span> Linguistic descriptions
(e.g.,“suppose this is my car”) may be required to connect symbols to
real-world particulars, especially when the referent is not present in
the scene.</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<p>Rakoczy et al. (2005) are not alone in assuming that understanding
objects as symbols rests on natural language. Spelke (1990) also opposes
the idea that infants interpret nonlinguistic stimuli as
representational, citing infants’ grasping behavior toward pictures as
evidence. As already noted, these data are difficult to interpret. But
even if infants do not interpret pictures as symbols initially, the
conclusion that the symbolic nature of pictures must be derived from
language cannot be valid. By this token, if newborns do not expect words
to be symbolic, one should conclude that they would have to derive this
from language - an infinite loop.</p>
<p>In sum, the case for the primacy of language over STAND-FOR relations
is not incontrovertible. However, the possibility that language is
necessary for infants to understand symbol objects cannot be excluded at
this point either. At the same time, infants do seem open to the types
of entities that carry meaning (e.g., spoken language, signed gestures),
which could point an early broad SYMBOL concept that needs to be
fine-tuned with experience. If infants’ knowledge is divided into core
systems with dedicated inputs (Spelke &amp; Kinzler, 2007) that compete
for attention (Spelke &amp; Kinzler, 2007), this will make symbol
objects more challenging than other types of symbols. Because symbol
objects are, after all, objects, they might trigger other core systems
as well (e.g., the object system), which would cause a developmental
delay relative to words, for instance, which do not tap into any core
system.</p>
<h2 id="the-flagging-account">THE FLAGGING ACCOUNT</h2>
<p>The proposal closest in form to the one defended here is the flagging
model of pretense in Harris and Kavanaugh (1993). According to them,
children engaging in object substitution pretense have two operations at
their disposal. First, they can attach a flag to a mental representation
of the current pretend episode. This flag can take props in its scope,
which allows children to keep track of the make-believe identities
(e.g., this yellow brick = make-believe banana). The flagging operation
is meant to preserve the integrity of the cognitive system, following
Leslie’s (1987) prescription, and corresponds to setting up a stand-for
relation between an object symbol and a discourse referent in the
account I am advocating. Second, they can edit these flags to keep track
of pretend action consequences on the action participants (e.g., this
make-believe banana has been eaten). This corresponds to taking the
actions performed on a given symbol (e.g., moving the banana towards the
mouth of the gorilla) and turning it into properties ascribed to the
discourse referent (e.g., the banana was eaten). In addition, Harris and
Kavanaugh (1993) explicitly link pretense to story comprehension, which
the introduction of discourse referents also implies.</p>
<p>However, the flagging model diverges from the account defended here
in two respects. On the one hand, the flagging operations were
specifically introduced to account for object substitution pretense, not
for external representations writ large. On the other, Harris and
Kavanaugh follow Leslie (1987) in assuming that the relation between the
props and the referents to be an identity relation,quarantined by the
flag that attaches to the mental episode. <span
class="math inline"><sup>8</sup></span> By contrast,I have argued that
the relevant relation is not an identity one (e.g., brick = banana) but
a representational one (e.g., brick stands for banana). This removes the
need of additional quarantining, whether at the level of props or entire
pretend episodes.</p>
<p>In short, the flagging model introduces mechanisms that do not
generalize to other communicative media because it is overfitted to
pretend play. Moreover, Harris (2000) argued that pretend play is
tightly connected to imagination, simulation, and counterfactual thought
(see Lillard, 2001, for a similar analysis). While pretend play may
train children on all these capacities, setting up the relevant
symbol-referent relations do not rely on these capacities but precede
them. Indeed, while toddlers’ abilities to understand pretense
stipulations are impressive, their creativity in early production is
limited to imitating the actions of adults (Adair &amp; Carruthers,
2022; Harris, 2021; Striano et al., 2001).</p>
<h2 id="summary">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The main difference between the symbolic account and the alternatives
reviewed in this section lies in the nature of the relation between the
proverbial banana and the corresponding phone. Under the symbolic
account, this relation consists of a perceptually available object
(e.g., the banana) and a discourse referent (e.g., the phone).
Internally, the two are encoded in distinct representations that are
linked such that the actions that are taken on the banana are
interpreted as properties or events ascribed to the phone. According to
the decoupling, flagging, and behavioral accounts, this relation is not
a symbolic one but an identity or a property attribution one: “this
banana is a phone”. This representation is quarantined by decoupling, by
flagging, or because the child only acts as if the representation were
true. According to previous symbolic accounts of pretend play (Rakoczy
et al., 2005), the relation is a representational relation but one that
does not have a discourse referent as a relatum but a property or a
kind: “this banana symbolizes PHONE”. As we have seen, this cannot be
true: if the banana only symbolizes the kind PHONE, one would not be
able to use it as a phone: one can only use phone tokens to make phone
calls.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>8</sup></span> Harris &amp;
Kavanaugh,1993,p. 63: “[A] flag can refer to an isolated prop or to a
set of props. For example,[…] the flag might read, ‘During this episode,
yellow bricks are (make-believe) bananas’. In effect, the child allows
the flagging process to operate only within the context of a particular
make-believe episode.”</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<p>Moreover, the accounts put forth specifically for pretense fail to
account for the similarities between pretend play and other
representational media (Harris, 2000; Leslie, 1987; Rabkina &amp;
Forbus, 2022). Because of this, these accounts propose mechanisms such
as decoupling, which become superfluous once pretend play is aligned
with drawings, animations, and the like. The accounts that do attempt to
explain representational understanding writ large do not take pretend
play seriously enough (DeLoache, 2004; Perner, 1991) or gloss it as a
derived competence that is rooted in theory of mind or language (Rakoczy
et al., 2005; Spelke, 2022) seriously enough (DeLoache, 2004; Perner,
1991) or gloss it as a derived competence that is rooted in theory of
mind or language (Rakoczy et al., 2005; Spelke, 2022). Based on the
current data and theoretical considerations, there is no good reason to
conclude that understanding nonlinguistic representations is a late
achievement in human childhood, or that it necessarily depends on other
cognitive faculties. Instead, the capacity may emerge earlier than is
usually assumed and cover a broader range of phenomena than is often
acknowledged.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Positing a cognitive capacity to interpret objects as symbols for
discourse referents successfully accounts for object substitution
pretense-a universal, early-emerging, and uniquely human behavior. As
illustrated by the offside example in the Introduction, this phenomenon
is not confined to early development. Instead, the same kind of object
substitutions that pretend play relies on are used throughout the human
lifespan, whenever distal objects and events are depicted by using
objects as symbols. This proposal is more parsimonious than the
available alternatives in PRETEND PLAY AND SYMBOLS two respects. First,
it has a broader explanatory scope, as it aligns pretend play with other
communicative media that are isomorphic to it, such as animations or
puppet shows. In all these cases, humans - irrespective of developmental
stage - must track objects in the here and now (the symbols) but
interpret them in terms of the entities the objects stand for (the
discourse referents). Second, the introduction of a principled
distinction between medium and content bypasses the need for additional
cognitive operations, such as decoupling. Because symbols stand for
discourse referents, the distinction between the two comes for free,
and, hence, they will not be mixed up. Because the discourse referents
are spatiotemporally undefined by default, the episodic contents
predicated about the discourse referent will not be stored as beliefs
about the real world. Finally, because pretend play is a subspecies of
communication, quarantining the generic contents involved in pretense
will not occur either. As a result, object substitutions in pretense can
be used to teach and learn about the world, just like language or any
other representational system.</p>
