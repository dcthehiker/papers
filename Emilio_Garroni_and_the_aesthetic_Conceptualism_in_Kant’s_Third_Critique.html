Garroni and the aesthetic Conceptualism in Kant’s Third Critique</h1>
<p>Luca Forgione*</p>
<p>ABSTRACT</p>
<p>In recent years, nonconceptual content theories have seen Kant as a
reference point for his notion of intuition (§§ 1-3). This work aims to
dismiss the possibility that intuition is provided with an autonomous
function of de re knowledge. To this end, it will explore certain
epistemological points that emerge from Garroni’s reading of the Third
Critique in the conviction that they provide a suitable context to
verify the presence of autonomous, epistemically nonconceptual content
in the transcendental system (§§ 4-5). It is here, in fact, that Kant
discusses those cases where intuition is given without bringing into
play the conceptual component. As Garroni posits, in this frame of
reference, such content cannot subsist without the interplay between
aesthetic and conceptual dimensions (§§ 6-7). Long before the
development of the debate on Kantian nonconceptualism, and during the
period in which the Kantian debate on the epistemic considerations
contained in the Third Critique was developing deeply for the first
time, Garroni had already identified a theoretical position on these
issues, which can be labelled aesthetic conceptualism, thanks to his
fundamentally epistemological reading of the Third Critique.KEYWORDS</p>
<p>Kant, Conceptualism, Nonconceptualism, Power of Judgment, Aesthetic
Judgment1.</p>
<p>Aesthetics and Cognition in Kant’s Critical Philosophy was published
in 2006. That work consisted of a series of essays by leading Kantian
scholars on the challenging relationship between aesthetic and epistemic
reflection in the Critique of the Power of Judgment.</p>
<p>Apart from two giants of continental philosophy - Martin Heidegger
and Gilles Deleuze - who took very seriously the fundamental unity of
the entire transcendental project articulated in Kant’s three Critiques,
Kant’s Third Critique received less attention than the first two for
most of the twentieth century as it was judged to be simply a dated
treatise on art, beauty and artistic genius. Indeed, Kant’s aesthetic
theory was marginalised by most philosophers because they did not
consider aesthetics as substantively relevant to the main topics of
epistemology and ethic of Kantian enterprise.</p>

<p>For the authors of Aesthetics and Cognition in Kant’s Critical
Philosophy, the critical epistemological program introduced in Kant’s
Critique of Pure Reason cannot be separated from his account of
aesthetic judgement, imagination and sensibility articulated primarily
in the Critique of the Power of Judgment. Kukla (2006), editor of the
book, highlights this total change of direction within the
Anglo-American debate, in particular by noting the publication of some
significant contributions: Theodore Uehling’s (1971) The Notion of Form
in Kant’s Critique of Aesthetic Judgment, Donald Crawford’s (1974)
Kant’s Aesthetic Theory, Eva Schaper’s (1979) Studies in Kant’s
Aesthetics and the first edition of Paul Guyer’s (1979) Kant and the
Claims of Taste. From 1990 forward, philosophical attention to the
systematic connections between aesthetic theory and the cognitive
dimension became a reference point in the Kantian debate with several
classic contributions, such as Béatrice Longuenesse’s (1998) Kant and
the Capacity to Judge and Henry E. Allison’s (2001) Kant’s Theory of
Taste.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy in this context that, already in 1976 with his essay
Estetica ed epistemologia. Riflessioni sulla “Critica del giudizio”,
Emilio Garroni had reconstructed a precise epistemological progression
in the Third Critique. In the following years, he pointed out the
so-called question of the Sense, especially in his foundational books
Senso e Paradosso (1986) and Estetica. Uno sguardo-attra-verso (1992).
In particular with respect to the former, he analysed some essential
aspects of transcendental philosophy through an interpretative reading
of Kant’s Critique of the Power of Judgment. Specifically, in a very
dense textual passage, Garroni affirms that the task of philosophy
consists of comprehension, which can be conceptualised as tracing back
experience, through experience itself, towards the conditions of its
possibility. Alongside the question of Meaning - in Kantian terms, the
application of conceptual forms to intuitions within the form of
judgement in order to have experience and knowledge - Garroni introduces
the question of Sense as the fulfilment of the transcendental paradigm
which clarifies the critical philosophy in its founding paradox.</p>
<p>The question of Sense is based on an aesthetic principle that is
irreducible to the principles of the intellect: Philosophy can question
the Meaning of experience’s conditions (that belongs to nature or art)
by tracing it back the Sense - i.e., the condition of the conditioned -
only from within the determined experience and through it, not from a
non-place outside of it. In this way, he developed an approach to
Aesthetics defined as non-special philosophy, which also reflects its
emphasis on the features assigned to the reflective judgement and its a
priori principle developed in the Critique of the Power of Judgment.
Garroni’s analysis of the power of judgement (Urteilskraft) in the Third
Critique goes beyond an explanation of the so-called judgements of taste
and the notion of beauty as composing a critique of taste. Instead, from
these he reinterprets a teleological as well as epistemological meaning
and, more generally, engages with the very possibility of empirical
knowledge.</p>
<p>With respect to the specific issue concerning the formation of
empirical knowledge, in recent years nonconceptual content theorists
have held Kant as a reference point for his notion of intuition (§§
2-3). In this work, I will analyse several complementary issues that
intertwine with respect to the notion of nonconceptual content as it
concerns the very possibility of empirical knowledge. This work will
dismiss the possibility that intuition is provided with an autonomous
function of de re knowledge. To this end, I will explore certain
epistemological points emerging from Garroni’s reading of the Critique
of the Power of Judgment to demonstrate whether these verify the
presence of autonomous, epistemically nonconceptual content in the
transcendental system (§§ 4-5). It is here, in fact, that Kant discusses
those cases where intuition is given without bringing to bear the
conceptual component. As Garroni holds, in this regard, such content
cannot exist absent the interplay between the aesthetic and conceptual
dimensions, between Sense and Meaning.</p>
<p>Long before the debate on Kantian nonconceptualism developed, and
indeed during the period in which the Kantian debate on the epistemic
considerations contained in the Third Critique were originally emerging,
Garroni had already identified a theoretical position on these issues.
We could call Garroni’s position aesthetic conceptualism due to his
fundamental epistemological reading of the Third Critique (§§ 6-7).

aspects of these topics in Forgione (2018) by referring to the so-called
theory of the concept of a transcendental object contained in the First
Critique in support of an interpretative reading which can be labelled
as weak conceptualism. In this paper, I attempt to reach the same
conclusion pursuant to certain epistemological points emerging from
Garroni’s reading of Third Critique. English quotations are from the

<p>Kant is widely regarded as the preeminent philosopher of the
conceptualist position-the perspective that holds it to be impossible to
obtain knowledge, experience or perception of reality without conceptual
capacities. In the last decade, Kant has also become a key reference
point for even theorists of nonconceptual content by virtue of a
detailed reflection on the sensible dimension and, in particular, on the
related notion of intuition.</p>
<p>McDowell is one of the most influential contemporary theorists of
conceptualism. In Mind and World, he examines several components of the
Kantian approach - largely filtered through Sellars’ controversial
reading - to assert a Kantian conceptualist theory of cognition and to
attack any other approach based on a nonconceptual content, such as that
proffered by Evans. According to recent interlocutors in the Kantian
debate on nonconceptual content, however, Sellars and McDowell have not
properly recognised Kant’s fundamental contribution to the
nonconceptualist theory. Moreover, some claim that the contemporary
debate itself has not adequately emphasised its own debt to Kant,
leading Hanna (2006, pp.90-91) to posit that “Kant’s theory of intuition
is the hidden historical origin of both sides of the debate between
conceptualists and nonconceptualists”.</p>
<p>The debate on nonconceptual content occurs among several not entirely
consistent positions. It has developed from several theoretical sources,
among which Evans’ Varieties of Reference particularly stands out. While
it is difficult to find agreed upon definitions in the current debate,
Bermúdez’s (2003) general considerations provide an adequate starting
point. Bermúdez argues that, if the content of a (human or non-human)
creature’s mental state consists in what that mental state actually
represents then, according to the theory of nonconceptual mental
content, certain mental states represent reality even if their holder
does not possess the concepts required to articulate that content. More
precisely, while conceptualism holds that the mental states of non-human
creatures have no mental content because they lack the requisite
conceptual apparatus, nonconceptualism regards representational content
as determined not only (or not exclusively) by conceptual capability,
but also by certain nonconceptual capacities shared by infants and
non-human creatures (cf. Evans, 1982; Bermúdez, 2003; Gunther, 2003;
Hanna, 2008, 2011).</p>
<p>Utilising the nonconceptualist approach, Speaks (2005, p.360)
distinguishes two theses. According to the first, positing absolutely
nonconceptual content and endorsed by Evans (1982), Peacocke (1992),
Heck (2000), a mental state contains absolutely non-conceptual content
if and only if the type of content that comprises the mental state is
different from the type of content that comprises beliefs and thoughts.
The second thesis concerns the relationship between subject and content,
asserting the existence of a relatively nonconceptual content.
Specifically, the second thesis posits that a subject’s mental state at
time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> consists of relatively
nonconceptual content if and only if the content of the mental state in
question includes contents not conceptually grasped or held by the
subject at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> .</p>
<p>Against what he labels Relativist Nonconceptualism - which ultimately
leads, in his view, to a Highly Refined Conceptualism - Hanna (2008)
introduces several Kantian nonconceptualist arguments, including the
well-known Two Hands Argument. That argument holds that incongruent
counterparts do not possess any descriptive or conceptual difference and
can be distinguished only from a perceptual perspective. As such, while
Hanna advances an absolutely nonconceptual content, Kantian
nonconceptualists have articulated several propositions within the
transcendental system to identify comparatively nonconceptual content in
intuition (cf. Allais 2009). Within this general framework, the
difference between the content that attends nonconceptual cognition and
conceptual cognition, respectively, seems to reflect the Kantian
distinction between concepts and intuitions. In other words, intuitive
representations are assumed to possess certain semantic features
pertaining to the indexical dimension along with some epistemic features
articulated according to the distinction between knowledge by
acquaintance and knowledge by description (cf. Hanna, 2008; de Sá
Pereira, 2013).3.</p>
<p>In three classic passages (Log, p.589, A19/B33 and A320/B376), Kant
articulates the difference between the two primary types of
representations, intuitions and concepts. Starting with the
mathematical-philosophical debate instigated by Hintikka (1967, 1969,
1972) and Parsons (1969, 1984, 2012), the conditions that must be
fulfilled in order for a representation to be classified as an intuition
have been articulated. In the passages referenced above, Kant argues
that intuition is a singular representation. This is the singularity
condition which posits, based on the type of denotation involved, that
an intuition is a singular representation denoting an individual object.
A concept, on the other hand, relates to different objects that may be
classified under its domain on account of the presence of a property the
concept represents. In the second and third passages, Kant adds that an
intuition is “immediately related to the object”. Here, he articulates
the immediacy condition, which concerns the type of relationship - once
again immediate - between the representation and its denotation. This is
opposed to a concept, which refers to its object through the mediation
of the conceptual features or marks composing the concept’s
intension.</p>
<p>Although the latter condition has been at the centre of a harsh
dispute between Hintikka and Parson (cf. Capozzi 1973; 2020), several
commentators have linked the immediacy condition with the referential
directness of the intuition. These scholars contend that intuitive
representations not only induce the immediate cognition of objects, but
also identify them without the mediation of any conceptual or
descriptive content. If concepts and intuitions are two distinct types
of objective representations, then, from a strict epistemic point of
view, they are both necessarily involved in judgement for the
determination of objective knowledge. Hence the well-known adage,
“Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are
blind”.</p>
<p>The togetherness principle, which posits that knowledge is produced
only through the joint intervention of concepts and intuitions, was
supported by McDowell’s Kant-inspired conceptualist position (A50/B74).
Hanna (2006) argues against this position and proposes instead that
concepts and intuitions are cognitively and semantically interdependent
only with respect to the constitution of objectively valid judgments.
Beyond this specific epistemic dimension consisting only of empirically
meaningful judgments, empty concepts or blind intuitions are certainly
possible. Hanna essentially distinguishes a direct relation of the
perceptual dimension in the Kantian approach: intuitions are cognitive
representations that are semantically independent from concepts with
nonconceptual cognitive contents. Against this background, the
togetherness principle is consistent with Kantian nonconceptualism on
account of the epistemic and metaphysical independence of the intuitive
representation.</p>
<p>As such, the power of judgement would be necessary only for objective
cognition and not for perception. The latter would depend only on
intuitive representations without the intervention of concepts, which
are the general rules that constitute judgements. The overall aim of
nonconceptualists is primarily to delimit conceptualist claims
underlying the argumentative structure of Transcendental Deduction. This
includes some arguments concerning the conditions of knowledge and
experience, namely that they are based on the application of conceptual
forms to sensible intuitions through a deflationary strategy aimed at
weakening the togetherness principle. As already observed, the power of
judgement is allegedly necessary only for objective knowledge, not for
perception. Instead, perception is assumed to rely on the use of
intuitive representations without the intervention of concepts, or
general rules constituting judgements (cf. Hanna 2006; Allais 2009).</p>
<p>The Kantian nonconceptualist strategy has several additional
ramifications. In particular, it refers to those passages from
Transcendental Deduction (A89/B122, B132, B145), claiming that no
intervention of the intellect is required in order to ensure that
phenomenal objects are given in intuition. Second, it distinguishes
figurative from intellectual synthesis. Third, it asserts that intuition
may be based on the nonconceptual activity of synthesis. <span
class="math inline"><sup>2</sup></span> Accordingly, beginning from a
rejection of the conceptualist approach in the manner of McDowell,
intuition can be assumed to provide a separate perceptual presentation
of spatio-temporally located mind-independent entities, be they objects
or empirical details.</p>
<p>The analysis presented here will not engage with the different
interpretations of Transcendental Deduction passages suggested in the
debate. It is one thing to establish that the intuitive representation
provides a peculiar, autonomous (with respect to conceptual forms)
contribution to content. It is quite another to maintain that such a
contribution allows perception of an object independently of any
conceptual articulation through an autonomous epistemic function of de
re presentation assigned to intuitions. According to Garroni’s
interpretative reading of Third Critique, the question of Sense regards
the non-intellectual condition of experience. This condition, however,
cannot but involve an intellectual legality in order to establish a
conceptual reference.</p>

<p><span class="math inline"><sup>2</sup></span> As to the first
point,cf. Hanna (2001,p.199) (2005,p.259),Allais (2009,p.396) and
Schulting (2012, p. 84); however, cf. also the antithetical
conceptualist interpretations of A89/B122 by Allison (2001, p.38), Grüne
(2011). As for the other two points, Allais (2009) draws attention to
the passages on the threefold synthesis in the first edition of the
Transcendental Deduction. With respect to apprehension and reproduction,
only recognition involves the conceptual dimension. Second, Allais
refers to A78/B103, where a distinction is drawn between the
imagination’s synthesis and the functions of the intellect. Several
commentators (see e.g., Ginsborg, 2008; Schulting, 2012) have rejected
this reading, highlighting the passages where synthetic activity is
attributed to the intellect (e.g., B129) and the spontaneity of the
imagination is paralleled with that of the intellect (e.g., B162n). For
an overview of the development of this debate, cf. the essays contained
in Schulting (2016), especially Heidemann’s article, which develops
arguments according to which Kant advocates a kind of aesthetic
nonconceptualism in the Third Critique on the basis the doctrine of the
judgement of taste.</p>

<p>It is well known that, in the context of the First Critique, one of
the most important epistemological roles is played by the imagination’s
(Einbildungskraft) operation of exhibition (Darstel-lung). This depends
on the exhibition of conceptual forms and, in particular, on the
application of concepts to empirical intuitions through direct
schematism. As a result, the imagination is assigned an unprecedented
mediating function from both the transcendental and empirical
perspectives. The possibility of applying concepts unbinds the
imagination from the use of images. Kant asserts an explicit difference
between schema and image, acknowledging schematism as having a specific
procedural function that allows the application of the conceptual
dimension and the subsumption of the sensible particular. As such, from
a strictly empirical point of view, Kant combines two roles in the
imagination: the traditional exercise of the active memory (cf. B120;
Anth <span class="math inline">$28</span> ) and the new cognitive
function of mediation among heterogeneous faculties.</p>
<p>This issue is significantly different if we consider the free
schematism and creative imagination introduced by Kant in the Critique
of the Power of Judgment. While, in the First Critique, the objective
schematism of the imagination (KU <span class="math inline">§9</span> )
is solely used to mediate between conceptual and intuitive components,
the free schematism of the KU examines cases in which one of those two
elements is missing. In the famous passage KU § 59, for example, Kant
discusses so-called symbolic or indirect exhibition. In the absence of
empirical intuition, an abstract concept (in Kant’s example, the concept
of a monarchical state) is expressed by building an analogy to the
manner in which the power of judgement operated in a previous, different
direct schematization (that between the concept and the intuition of a
hand mill). As such, Darstellung does not rest on direct intuition -
which is absent because of the abstract nature of concepts - but rather
on the form of the reflection.</p>
<p>The second case is particularly important for the debate on
non-conceptualism as it is precisely a concept suitable to a given
intuition that is missing. The paradigmatic example concerns aesthetic
ideas, also known as innere Anschauungen: “by an aesthetic idea
[ästhetischen Idee], I mean that representation of the imagination
[Vorstellung der Einbildungskraft] that occasions much thinking though
without it being possible for any determinate thought, i.e., concept, to
be adequate to it, which, consequently, no language fully attains or can
make intelligible” (KU § 49).</p>
<p>Kant assigns a new role to imagination - now regarded as the faculty
of presentation (Vermögen der Darstellung) (KU § 23) - following the
introduction of the <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> priori
principle of purposiveness (Zweckmäßigkeit) that underlies the power of
judgement (Urteilsk-raft) and the feeling of pleasure and displeasure
(Gefühl der Lust und Unlust), which comprises up one of the three
faculties of the soul. Analysis of the power of judgement transcends the
explanation of so-called judgements of taste and the notion of beauty
composing a critique of taste. From these, the analysis reinterprets a
teleological and epistemological issue and, more generally, addresses
the very possibility of empirical knowledge. This appears utterly
undetermined if one clings to the sole dictates of the <span
class="math inline"><em>K</em><em>r</em><em>V</em></span> and its
analysis of all phenomena as comprised of synthetic a priori judgements.
Garroni cites Scaravelli’s example: it is not possible to spot the
difference between a rock and a volcanic eruption solely by reference to
the transcendental laws of nature.</p>
<p>In other words, the issue here is the transition from the principles
of pure understanding and nature in general (Natur überhaupt) to the
possibility of knowing nature in its particularity, that is, in its own
particular laws and empirical concepts. These particular laws and
empirical concepts are contained within those principles but cannot be
deduced by them a priori (KU, Intr. § IV). This is the so-called problem
of the third manifold, introduced by Scaravelli (1968) and developed by
Garroni (1986), which addresses the transcendental problem of
understanding the possibility of the apprehension of an empirical object
in its concrete particularity. In this respect, Garroni points out that
Kant makes a distinction between ‘cognition in general’ and ‘cognition
(of given objects) in general’ (Erkenntnis [gegebener Gegenstände]
überhaupt) (KU § 21):</p>
<p>In the first case, Scaravelli would have noted it is merely ‘the
analytical texture of all phenomena’ that is at stake, meaning an
agreement between pure concepts and phenomena in general, whatever they
may be, regardless of their particularity. However, once such an
agreement has been legitimised as a general matter, there is nothing
that requires an agreement based in experience, which could present
itself not only as infinitely varied, but even as unorganizable (Garroni
1986, p. 216).</p>
<p>For Garroni, the two epistemic dimensions described in the foregoing
are not simply two aspects of Kant’s approach. Instead, they
collectively constitute a kind of transcendental paradigm.</p>
<p>In the KU, Kant describes two different operations executed by the
faculty of judgement (Urteilskraft). Of these, the determining power of
judgement (bestimmende Urteilskraft) is articulated in the KrV as the
subsumption power in which the universal - the rule to be applied to
intuition - is given a priori. As stated previously, the question
essentially addresses the application of the universal, necessary forms
of the pure principles of the intellect. On the other hand, the
reflecting power of judgement (reflektierende Urteilskraft) is
legitimated in the KU, requiring a new a priori principle. Here, even if
the universal rule is absent, experience must be ensured for the very
reason that the intellect’s principles of the First Critique are
necessary but not sufficient conditions for empirical knowledge. With
respect to empirical knowledge, such principles produce synthetic units
for the general knowledge of nature. Nonetheless, with respect to
transcendental laws, certain empirical units of cognition are analytical
units in that they all necessarily share the same principles. For this
reason, in the First Introduction to the KU, Kant clearly articulates
the necessity for further synthetic unity also with respect to the
differences among them (KU, First Intr. § VIII).</p>
<p>Such is the epistemological problem of the regulative role of the
principle of purposiveness. It allows the manifold particular phenomena
of nature - the ‘aggregate’ as Kant described it - to be connected as
though it constituted a system (cf. Guyer 1990, 2003; Guyer, Walker
1990). Garroni (1986) suggests that this may occur even if such a
systematic unity of particular laws has no character of necessity, as
with the transcendental laws, but is instead built by the power of
judgement according to the analogic principle of purposiveness. With
respect to this epistemological context, the principle of purposiveness
is purely subjective; that is, it prescribes not to nature but to the
subject itself a law of specification for a reflection on nature based
on its empirical laws. As such, it guides the power of judgement in its
reflecting function, forming additional systematic knowledge.5.</p>
<p>The intrinsic bond between the purposiveness and the feeling of
pleasure and displeasure is touched on in the crucial seventh paragraph
of the introduction to the KU, where Kant specifically addresses
aesthetic judgements. He makes a distinction between what is simply
subjective in the representation of an object - i.e., its aesthetic
quality - and the elements used for to determine the object in order to
gain knowledge, namely its logical validity. In this respect, Kant adds
that whatever is subjective in a representation is not an element of
knowledge, such as the feeling of pleasure and displeasure experienced
in connection with its apprehension and purposiveness. Purposiveness, as
being represented in perception, is in fact not a quality of the
object.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important concepts in Garroni’s reading of
the Third Critique. With respect to aesthetic judgements, the simple
apprehension of an object in the intuition is accompanied by the feeling
of pleasure. The representation here is related to the subject - not to
the object - and the pleasure expresses the object’s suitability as it
relates to the subject’s cognitive faculties. In this way, it is indeed
a subjective formal purposiveness. As for the matter of taste, the
reflecting power of judgement takes on an aesthetic role in that it is
based on the simple apprehension of the form of the sensible
representation solely as connected to the feeling of pleasure or, in
other words, to an inherently subjective component. Nonetheless, it also
- and even more importantly - assumes a constitutive role ‘deduced’ as
an a priori principle of Urteilskraft überhaupt turning into Gemeinsinn
(sense or common sense). Stated differently, the aesthetic reflecting
power of judgement is the universal condition expressing a priori the
harmonization of the faculties in free play, which operates in the
predisposition of the mental equipment common to all and universally
communicable.</p>
<p>The key point is that the very predisposition of the faculties is
also involved in the epistemological field as well as in the more
specific formation of the conceptual dimension. <span
class="math inline"><sup>3</sup></span> In the context of general logic,
the analysis abstracts certain representations from their contents. Pure
concepts may differ from empirical concepts in substance (matter).
While, with respect to the former, the content may be given a priori or
constructed, in the latter the content must be derived from experience.
Nonetheless, both have the same universal form, while differing in their
sources. What is more, in several passages Kant describes comparison,
reflection and abstraction as necessary acts to constitute the form of a
conceptual representation starting from an empirical intuition (Log,
p. 592; on this topic, cf. Capozzi 2002).</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>3</sup></span> Longuenesse
(1998,p. 116) argues that the formation of concepts depends on a
universalizing comparison, a logical act of comparison understood as a
function of the capacity to judge according to the concepts of
comparison introduced in the Amphiboly chapter (B 316). Allison (2001)
instead moves from the definition of reflection found in the First
Introduction to the Third Critique-where reflection is understood as the
activity of comparison among the very representations from which
empirical concepts form and that between representations and faculties,
from which aesthetic judgements are formed. On this topic, Ginsborg
(2015, § VII) goes further and explains the acquisition of empirical
concepts on the basis of a normative account of the Third Critique. A
precise correlation between the aesthetic and other types of reflective
judgements is thus established according to the analysis of the a priori
principle of the reflecting power of judgement. As regards the formation
of empirical concepts, Garroni (1986; 2003) focuses on free schematism,
namely the relative role of the creative imagination introduced in the
KU thanks to the new reflecting function of the faculty of judgement,
and, in particular, on what he calls “image-schemas” (see below). A
comparison between the different readings of this and other related
themes concerning the Third Critique, however - most notably Guyer
(2006), who rejects Allison’s interpretative approach - is beyond the
scope of this essay.</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<p>In the context of transcendental philosophy, and considering the
operation of reflecting judgement, when a concept is missing and the
faculties in free play must find an agreement with a sensible
representation to ensure an experience, the role of the power of
judgement - and of imagination, along with free schematism - becomes
pre-eminent as a constructive device. Here, Garroni (1986, p. 219)
articulates the aesthetic nature of the principle of the reflecting
power of judgement: “it is not an intellectual, nor a cognitive or
logical unity […] rather, it is to feel the agreement of imagination and
intellect under the sign of the imagination, which is preliminary to any
explicit agreement, already consummated under the sign of the
intellect”. At the same time, Garroni points out that the power of
judgement is more than a purely formal and aesthetic activity restricted
to the feeling of pleasure, as with judgements of taste. In fact, the
power of judgement chiefly endeavours to facilitate agreement between
the imagination and the intellect on account of this a priori
anticipation of the experience in its own particularity (KU <span
class="math inline">§9</span> ) promoted by the aesthetic activity
proper. In other words, judgement seeks to promote harmony between the
imagination and the intellect according to a particular proportion
between the two faculties (KU § 21), anticipating the context where
genuine empirical knowledge may arise through a universally communicable
disposition.</p>
<p>Among the different proportions, the most suitable for the
disposition of the faculties of the soul is determined by feeling. Once
again, the free play of the faculties, understood as common sense, is
assumed as the unifying principle underlying not only the aesthetic
power of judgement, but also the power of judgement tout court, even in
its epistemic predisposition. The proportion of the powers depending on
feeling is “the subjective condition of cognizing”. Without it, “the
cognition, as an effect, could not arise”, its internal relation being
“optimal for the animation of both powers of the mind (the one through
the other) with respect to cognition (of given objects) in general” (KU
§ 21).</p>
<p>At the heart of the Deduction (KU § 35), Kant contends that the power
of judgement applied to a representation in which an object is given
“requires the agreement of two powers of representation: namely, the
imagination (for the intuition and the composition of the manifold of
intuition), and the understanding (as representation for the concept of
the unity of this composition)”. The power of judgement - and,
paradigmatically, the power of taste (understood as the subjective power
of judgement) - “contains a principle of subsumption, not of intuitions
under concepts, but of the faculty of intuitions or presentations (i.e.,
of the imagination) under the faculty of concepts (i.e., the
understanding), insofar as the former in its freedom is in harmony with
the latter in its lawfulness”.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">

<p>In these dense passages, an important point emerges for Garroni and
also for the broader debate on nonconceptualism. Specifically, in the
absence of a concept, and through a merely empirical intuition, the
faculties are predisposed to necessarily discover agreement. This is
demonstrated even in the case of an indeterminate concept (KU § 23)
presented as a merely general, basic intellectual legality - in the KU
Kant speaks of harmony with the lawfulness of the understanding in
general - so as to build a reference (in other words, an actual concept
for that sensible representation assumed in its particularity). In
addition, in building such a reference, to enable the imagination,
according to such an aesthetic anticipation, to schematize freely - once
again, without the concept - although in view of (the construction of)
possible knowledge. In contrast to the exhibitio symbolica, where the
intuition (but not the concept) is missing, this free schematism - a
sort of oxymoron, if schematizing means to present concepts - specifies
the analogical criteria for the formation of empirical concepts
according to the a priori principle of Urteilskraft (Garroni 2003,
p. 41).</p>
<p>For this reason, it is possible to speak of aesthetic conceptualism
in Garroni’s reading of Third Critique. On the one hand, Garroni posits
that the most suitable proportion for the disposition of the faculties
of the soul is determined by feeling. That is, so to speak, the
aesthetic of his conceptualism, insofar as this disposition cannot be
determined through concepts, but only through feeling. On the other
hand, this aesthetic condition, which expresses a subjective principle
of the power of judgement in general, predisposes the faculties to find
an epistemic agreement. In this way, it is therefore not possible to
consider that the epistemic contribution of intuition does not involve
the predisposition of the faculties for the formation of possible
knowledge. Certainly, the intuitive representation provides a peculiar,
autonomous (with respect to conceptual forms) contribution to content,
but such a contribution does not allow perception of an object
independently of any conceptual articulation or involvement of the
faculties.</p>
<p>Garroni is clear about this specific point. The representations of
the imagination arising from the apprehension of an object’s forms in
intuition - that is, in the free play of the faculties - are certainly
rich in determinations. Nonetheless, they are also primarily the
presentations of indeterminate intellectual concepts as they are already
linked with intellectual legality. As Garroni (2003, p. 44) pointed out
with respect the term image-schema, these images are not just ‘given’,
they are instead original, imaginative-intellectual formulations
comprising the conditions of possible schemas. Indeed, they imply an
indeterminate relation between the imagination and the intellect which
may be gradually specified and articulated in increasingly determined
conceptual relations.7.</p>
<p>If a question concerns the formation of empirical concepts rather
than their application, the possibility of the activation of the
empirical scheme and its relative concept is prompted by a given
intuitive representation. In turn, the determination of such a
possibility is triggered by the image-schema - i.e., the ‘product’, so
to speak - of a vague relevantisation established by a general agreement
of the faculties. Such an agreement is ultimately based on the power of
the imagination to release representations from any specific concept
(or, as with aesthetic ideas, to render them unbound by definition) so
that, instead, these may be “available to concepts variously definable,
also in the sense of analogy” (Garroni, 2003, p. 46). Such is the
foundational premise of both empirical schemas and concepts which also
discloses the essence of the exhibitio sym-bolica as an applicative
variant of the same analogical procedure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, with respect to the current debate, the Kantian
nonconceptualist strategy consists in isolating empirical intuition so
that it can provide its own epistemic contribution. This is achieved by
invoking the sole imagination in a synthetic activity based on no given
conceptual dimension with respect to its relative judgement. Pursuant to
Garroni’s analysis of the specific features of the reflecting power of
judgement and its relative a priori principle, the KU supplies a picture
at odds not only with such a nonconceptualist position, but also with
respect to the specific role of imagination and judgements. In a crucial
passage, Kant affirms that “the apprehension of forms in the imagination
can never take place without the reflecting power of judgment, even if
unintentionally, at least comparing them to its faculty for relating
intuitions to concepts” (KU, Intr. § VII). For these reasons, intuition
cannot be considered an epistemically autonomous representation unless
the faculties intervene to find or build a conceptual reference
analogically.</p>
<p>As such, in Garroni’s terms of Senso e Paradosso (1986, p. 229),
Sense is rendered only through specific experiences and, in turn, each
specific experience is accompanied by Sense as a condition to its
possibility: “there is no discrete class of objects that only say or
serve something specific and, in a different class, objects that
completely disregard saying and serving concrete meaning, therefore
turning to pure stupefied contemplation, producing a feeling of
pleasure”. This condition of aesthetic possibility may be grasped only
paradoxically through the involvement of conceptual forms in function of
a possible experience</p>
