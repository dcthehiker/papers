We are beginning to understand how some of this information can be utilized to improve the users' experiences with interfaces and with one another. In this paper, we are interested in the personality of users. Personality has been shown to be relevant to many types of interactions; it has been shown to be useful in predicting job satisfaction, professional and romantic relationship success, and even preference for different interfaces. Until now, to accurately gauge users' personalities, they needed to take a personality test. This made it impractical to use personality analysis in many social media domains. In this paper, we present a method by which a user's personality can be accurately predicted through the publicly available information on their Twitter profile. We will describe the type of data collected, our methods of analysis, and the machine learning techniques that allow us to successfully predict personality. We then discuss the implications this has for social media design, interface design, and broader domains.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Index Terms-personality, social media</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>I. INTRODUCTION</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Social networking on the web has grown dramatically over the last decade. In January 2005, a survey of social networking websites estimated that among all sites on the web there were roughly 115 million members [14]. Just over five years later, Twitter alone has exceeded 200 million members. In the process of creating social networking profiles, users reveal a lot about themselves both in what they share and how they say it. Through self-description, status updates, photos, and interests, much of a user's personality comes out through their profile.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For decades, psychology researchers have worked to understand personality in a systematic way. After extensive work to develop and validate a widely accepted personality model, researchers have shown connections between general personality traits and many types of behavior. Relationships have been discovered between personality and psychological disorders [42], job performance [4] and satisfaction [24], and even romantic success [46].</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>This paper attempts to bridge the gap between social media and personality research by using the information people reveal in their online profiles. Our core research question asks whether social media profiles can predict personality traits. If so, then there is an opportunity to integrate the many results on the implications of personality factors and behavior into the users' online experiences and to use social media profiles as a source of information to better understand individuals. For example, the friend suggestion system could be tailored to a user based on whether they are more introverted or extraverted.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Previous work has shown that the information in users' Facebook profiles is reflective of their actual personalities, not an "idealized" version of themselves [3]. We expect Twitter to have similar characteristics, and that plus a broad user base of 200 million people makes it an ideal platform for study.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>We administered the Big Five Personality Inventory to 279 subjects through a Twitter application. In the process, we gathered their 2000 most recent public Twitter posts (tweets). This was aggregated, quantified, and passed through a text analysis tool to obtain a feature set. Using these statistics, we were able to develop a model that can predict personality on each of the five personality factors to within between 11% and <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="2" style="font-size: 119%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c38"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c25"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>18</mn></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> of the actual values.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The ability to predict personality has implications in many areas. Existing research has shown connections between personality traits and success in both professional and personal relationships. Social media tools that seek to support these relationships could benefit from personality insights. Additionally, previous work on personality and interfaces showed that users are more receptive to and have greater trust in interfaces and information that is presented from the perspective of their own personality features (i.e. introverts prefer messages presented from an introvert's perspective). If a user's personality can be predicted from their social media profile, online marketing and applications can use this to personalize their message and its presentation.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>We begin by presenting background on the Big Five Personality index and related work on personality and social media. We then present our experimental setup and methods for analyzing and quantifying Twitter profile information. To understand the relationship between personality and social media profiles, we present results on correlations between each profile feature and personality factor. Based on this, we describe the machine learning techniques used for classification and show how we achieve large and significant improvements over baseline classification on each personality factor. We conclude with a discussion of the implications that this work has for social media websites and for organizations that may utilize social media to better understand the people with whom they interact.</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK</div></div></h2><div><br></div><h3><div><div>A.The Big Five Personality Inventory</div></div></h3><div><br></div><div><div><div>The "Big Five" model of personality dimensions has emerged as one of the most well-researched and well-regarded measures of personality structure in recent years. The models five domains of personality, Openness, Conscientiousness, extroversion, Ageeableness, and Neuroticism, were conceived</div></div></div><div><br><ul><li>computer by Tupes and Christal [47] as the fundamental traits that emerged from analyses of previous personality tests [29]. McCrae &amp; Costa [28] and John [21] continued five-factor model research and consistently found generality across age, gender, and cultural lines [29]. Additional research has proved that different tests, languages, and methods of analysis do not alter the models validity [29], [10], [21], [27]. Such extensive research has led to many psychologists to accept the Big Five as the current definitive model of personality [43], [34]. It should be noted that the models dependence on trait terms indicates that the Big Five traits are based on a lexical approach to personality measurement [43], [9], [10], [16]. The Big Five traits are characterized by the following:</li></ul></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="2" id="mark-69e9dabf-16c5-4de4-bebe-2bd38c6ee77d" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br><!-- Media --><br><!-- figureText: Agreeableness --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/0196439e-eaca-7b98-9f30-0433ba8485cd_1.jpg?x=199&amp;y=199&amp;w=646&amp;h=655&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/0196439e-eaca-7b98-9f30-0433ba8485cd_1.jpg?x=199&amp;y=199&amp;w=646&amp;h=655&amp;r=0"><div><br></div><div><div><div>Fig. 1: A person has scores for each of the five personality factors. Together, the five factors represent an individual's personality.</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br><ul><li>Openness to Experience: curious, intelligent, imaginative. High scorers tend to be artistic and sophisticated in taste and appreciate diverse views, ideas, and experiences.</li></ul><br><ul><li>Conscientiousness: responsible, organized, persevering. Conscientious individuals are extremely reliable and tend to be high achievers, hard workers, and planners.</li></ul><br><ul><li>extroversion: outgoing, amicable, assertive. Friendly and energetic, extroverts draw inspiration from social situations.</li></ul><br><ul><li>Agreeableness: cooperative, helpful, nurturing. People who score high in agreeableness are peace-keepers who are generally optimistic and trusting of others.</li></ul><br><ul><li>Neuroticism: anxious, insecure, sensitive. Neurotics are moody, tense, and easily tipped into experiencing negative emotions.</li></ul><br></div><h2><div><div>B. Applications of the Big Five</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Much work has been done with personality as it relates to our lives and the choices we make. In terms of relationships with others, many relationships have been identified. Personality type is linked to whom users choose to friend on Facebook. [45] found that extraversion, agreeableness, and openness all correlated with friendship selection. Personality features have also been tied to many aspects of romantic relationships, including partner choice, level of attachment and success [8], [46]. In terms of interpersonal conflict, studies have associated Big Five traits with coping responses, vengefulness, and rumination [32],[5]. Social relationships aside, personality also relates to preferences. Rentfrow and Gosling [39] is one of many studies that found that personality is a factor that relates to the music an individual prefers to listen to. Jost et al. [23] also found that the personality type of an individual was able to predict whether they would be more likely to vote for McCain or Obama in 2008. Research has also found personality differences between self-professed "dog people" and "cat people" [37], [17]. Within the context of marketing and advertising, Big Five personality traits have been shown to accurately predict a consumers preference for national brands or independent brands [48]. Studies like this show a promising future for the integration of personality analysis and consumer profiling.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Many studies have demonstrated the usefulness of personality profiles within the professional context. Hodgkinson and Ford [20] found that personality traits affect job performance and satisfaction, and Barrick and Mount [4] correlated specific traits with occupational choices and proficiency. Big Five dimensions have proved valid predictors for team performance [31], counterproductive behaviors [41], and entrepreneurial status [49], among many other factors. [6] also revealed relationships between personality and behavior among managers, and Barrick and Mount found recurring personality profiles among both high-autonomy and low-autonomy positions in the workforce [5].</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>In the space of Human-Computer Interaction, one of the pioneering studies on the connection between personality and interface preference was presented in [30]. Users listened to audio readings of five book reviews which were written from the perspective of introverts vs. extroverts. Subjects were able to identify the personality differences between the reviews and showed an attraction to those which were closest to their own personality type. When the personality type matched, subjects were even more likely to buy the book being reviewed.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>This work was extended into ideas of Graphical User Interface design in [25]. Different GUIs were developed to represent introverted vs. extroverted personality types. As in [30], subjects could identify the personality differences and preferred the interface that matched their own personality type.</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>C. Personality Research and Social Media</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the first to look at the relationship between profile information provided in social networks and personality traits. However, there have been a few previous studies on how personality relates to social networking more generally.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="3" id="mark-bdf9955f-485c-4d53-8250-74b4e58cdc32" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><span style="display: inline;"><div><br><br><!-- Media --><br><!-- figureText: Personality Scores Personality Trait 45 Average Score 25 15 --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/0196439e-eaca-7b98-9f30-0433ba8485cd_2.jpg?x=190&amp;y=199&amp;w=662&amp;h=403&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/0196439e-eaca-7b98-9f30-0433ba8485cd_2.jpg?x=190&amp;y=199&amp;w=662&amp;h=403&amp;r=0"><div><br></div><div><div><div>Fig. 2: Average scores on each personality trait shown with standard deviation bars.</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>It has been shown in [40] that extroversion and conscientiousness positively correlate with the perceived ease of use of social media websites. extroversion was also shown to have a positive correlation with perceived usefulness of such sites. Not surprisingly, extroversion was also shown to correlate with the size of a user's social network in several studies [2], [44], [45]. There have also been mixed results for other personality traits. Work in [45] showed that individuals with high agreeableness scores were selected more often as friends and that people tended to choose friends with similar agreeableness, extroversion, and openness scores. This was not repeated in [44], but a correlation between openness and number of friends.</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>III. DATA COLLECTION</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>We created a Twitter application with two functions. First, it administered a 45-question version of the Big Five Personality Inventory [22] to users.

They are also used in `"games"` where users come up with tweets to go with a tag (e.g. #firstdraftmovielines is used with altered first movie lines created by users).</li></ul><br><ul><li>Number of links</li></ul><br><ul><li>Words per tweet</li></ul><br></div><div><div><div>For the number of @mentions, replies, hashtags, and links, we used the raw numbers and the average per tweet.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Our primary analysis was a basic processing of the text of the tweets. This was done by merging the collected tweets for a given user into a single "document" and analyzing that.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Previous research has shown that linguistic features can be used to predict personality traits [26], [36]. . Data collected in [36] was used in both studies. They had three separate sources of text, ranging from an average of 1,770 words to over 5,000 words per person.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>There is potential to apply these linguistic analysis methods to help predict personality by analyzing a person's tweets. However, the text samples used in earlier studies are much larger than are available to us through any twitter posting. Aggregating many tweets from a user gives more information, but as a series of disconnected statements rather than a coherent document as was used in other studies. Thus, it is unclear if Twitter text will be as connected to personality as was the case in other work. Tweets are much different sources of text. Each one is limited to 140 characters, and a compilation of tweets from a given user is more a stream of disjointed thoughts than a coherent narrative as is found in the text used in previous personality studies. Thus, it was not entirely clear whether tweets would be a useful source of data for this type of analysis.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>There were an average of 1914 words per user, and the distribution is shown in figure 3. The number of words ranged from 50 to 5724. These came from an average of 142.2 tweets, with one using having a maximum of 350 tweets and another with a minimum of 4 .</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Following the methods used in [26], [36] as well as other studies of social media behavior, such as [13], we utilized two main tools to analyze the content of users' tweets. The first is that Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool [35]. LIWC produces statistics on 81 different features of text in five categories. These include Standard Counts (word count, words longer than six letters, number of prepositions, etc.), Psychological Processes (emotional, cognitive, sensory, and social processes), Relativity (words about time, the past, the future), Personal Concerns (such as occupation, financial issues, health), and Other dimensions (counts of various types of punctuation, swear words). We excluded the Standard Counts and Other Dimension features to eliminate what is likely to be noise on the type of text we have. The exceptions are that we included word count, words per sentence, and swear word counts since these reflect verbosity and tone of the user. For the other three categories, the values are given as the percentage of words in the input that match words in a given category. For example, it counts the number of "social" words such as "talk", "us", and "friend", or "anxiety" words like "nervous", "afraid", and "tense". Correlations between these features and personality traits (e.g. anxiety words and neuroticism scores) would not be surprising. This produced 79 text features.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="4" id="mark-49807d52-aec3-470a-a733-393d748ec939" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><span style="display: inline;"><div><br><br><!-- Media --><br><!-- figureText: Words Per User 6000 lumber of Users 500 1000 1500 2000 --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/0196439e-eaca-7b98-9f30-0433ba8485cd_3.jpg?x=196&amp;y=197&amp;w=649&amp;h=441&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/0196439e-eaca-7b98-9f30-0433ba8485cd_3.jpg?x=196&amp;y=197&amp;w=649&amp;h=441&amp;r=0"><div><br></div><div><div><div>Fig. 3: Number of words per user.</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>In addition, we ran the text again the MRC Psycholinguistic Database, a list of over 150,000 words with linguistic and psycholinguistic features of each word.

At the same time, the trait is positively correlated with the use of "you", indicating the same people tend to talk about or to others. Agreeable people also tend to use "you" a lot, but are less likely to talk about achievements and money.</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br><!-- figureText: LIWC Language Features (79) Structural (3) Sentiment(1) Personality Prediction Algorithm MRC Language Features (14) Twitter Use (9) --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/0196439e-eaca-7b98-9f30-0433ba8485cd_3.jpg?x=953&amp;y=201&amp;w=622&amp;h=683&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/0196439e-eaca-7b98-9f30-0433ba8485cd_3.jpg?x=953&amp;y=201&amp;w=622&amp;h=683&amp;r=0"><div><br></div><div><div><div>Fig. 4: Features used for predicting personality.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>TABLE I: Average scores on each personality factor on a normalized 0-1 scale</div></div></div><div><br><div class="table-container"><table class="fixed-table"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Agree.</td><td>Consc.</td><td>Extra.</td><td>Neuro.</td><td><mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="5" style="font-size: 119%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-b"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D40E TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D429 TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D41E TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D427 TEX-B"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-b"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2E TEX-B"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="bold">Open</mi></mrow><mo mathvariant="bold">.</mo></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container></td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>0.697</td><td>0.617</td><td>0.586</td><td>0.428</td><td>0.755</td></tr><tr><td>Stdev</td><td>0.162</td><td>0.176</td><td>0.190</td><td>0.224</td><td>0.147</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>However, there are not such intuitive explanations for other correlations.

The difference between being 65% vs 75% extraverted, for example, is likely small enough that the error would not have many practical implications. Furthermore, in many cases, simply identifying a person as being on one side of the scale vs. the other (e.g. introverted vs. extraverted) is likely enough to offer features that are beneficial.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Since this research relies heavily on text analysis, the nature of text on Twitter raises an interesting challenge. We analyzed it with standard tools, but the standards of editing down and misspelling words on Twitter make it likely that there are language features that could be missed. Hhow to apply these tools on Twitter is an interesting question for future research.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The important question that comes from this research is how the results can be used. Drawing on research results like those discussed as related work, there is potential to integrate previous personality results into social media as a way to enhance the accuracy of certain features or the user's experience.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The research on interfaces and personality presented above showed that users preferred interfaces designed to represent personalities that most closely matched their own [30], [25]. This has significant implications for this work. With the ability to infer a user's personality, social media websites, e-commerce retailers, and even ad servers can be tailored to reflect the user's personality traits and present information such that users will be most receptive to it. For example, the presentation of ads could be adjusted based on the personality of the user. Similarly, product reviews from authors with personality traits similar to the user could be highlighted to increase trust and perceived usefulness by the user. Customized website "skins" could be created for different user personality types, as suggested in [7]. Our methods provide a straightforward way to obtain personality profiles of users without the burden of tests, and this will make it much easier to create personality-oriented interfaces.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>This same idea can be extended even further to advertising. While results of integrating personality to marketing have been mixed, some work has demonstrated connections between marketing techniques and consumer personality [33]. For e-commerce marketers, both those who advertise on social media sites and elsewhere, utilizing social media profiles as a way to determine consumer personality can make it easy to implement existing techniques that benefit from this knowledge of consumer background.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Consider Twitters friend recommendation feature, where people are suggested to the user as potential friends. Previous results on personality and relationships may indicate that people with certain personality types are more likely to add one another as friends. By integrating these findings into Twitters friend recommendation feature we would be able to more accurately predict who else on Twitter a user might be more likely to add.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Recommender systems may also benefit from integrating predicted personality values. Results showing correlations between personality and music taste are well established in the literature [39], [11], [19], [38]. Inferring personality traits from Twitter profiles may allow recommender systems to improve their accuracy by recommending music, and possibly other items, that are tailored to the user's personality profile. Collaborative filtering algorithms find people with similar tastes to the user, and then recommend items that those people like. This similarity is typically computed over shared ratings, but with personality information available, this could be used to give more weight to users who share similar personality traits. Such techniques have been successful when used with trust relationships [12]. An alternate use of personality in recommender systems would be to identify types of items that are liked by individuals with certain personality traits and to give those items greater consideration based on the user's personality profile. Developing these algorithms and evaluating them is a space open for future work.</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>VII. CONCLUSIONS</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>In this paper, we have shown that a users' Big Five personality traits can be predicted from the public information they share on Twitter. Our subjects completed a personality test and through the Twitter API, we collected publicly accessible information from their profiles. After processing this data, we found many small correlations in the data. Using the profile data as a feature set, we were able to train two machine learning algorithms - ZeroR and Gaussian Processes - to predict scores on each of the five personality traits to within <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="9" style="font-size: 119%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c25"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mo class="mjx-n" space="3"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2212"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-texatom space="3" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c38"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c25"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>11</mn></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo>−</mo><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>18</mn></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> of their actual value.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>With the ability to guess a user's personality traits, many opportunities are opened for personalizing interfaces and information. We discussed some of these opportunities for marketing and interface design above. However, there is much work to be pursued in this area.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>One area that deserves attention is the connection between personality and the actual social network. We considered two structural features - number of friends and network density - but we did not look at personality scores between friends. Understanding the connections between personality, tie strength [13], trust [14], and other related factors is an open space for research. By improving our knowledge of these relationships, we can begin to answer more sophisticated questions about how to present trusted, socially-relevant, and well-presented information to users.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="7" id="mark-c028aad5-ef28-4de3-a36f-9d58fa4b4e22" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><span style="display: inline;"><div><br><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>TABLE III: Mean Absolute Error on a normalized scale for each algorithm and personality trait.</div></div></div><div><br><div class="table-container"><table class="fixed-table"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Agree.</td><td>Consc.</td><td><mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="10" style="font-size: 119%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-b"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D404 TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D431 TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D42D TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D42B TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D41A TEX-B"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-b"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2E TEX-B"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="bold">Extra</mi></mrow><mo mathvariant="bold">.</mo></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container></td><td>Neuro.</td><td><mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="11" style="font-size: 119%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-b"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D40E TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D429 TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D41E TEX-B"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D427 TEX-B"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-b"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2E TEX-B"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="bold">Open</mi></mrow><mo mathvariant="bold">.</mo></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container></td></tr><tr><td>ZeroR</td><td>0.129980265</td><td>0.146204953</td><td>0.160241663</td><td>0.182122225</td><td>0.11923333</td></tr><tr><td>GaussianProcess</td><td>0.130675423</td><td>0.14599073</td><td>0.160315335</td><td>0.18205923</td><td>0.11922558</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><h2><div><div>VIII.
