<p>Abstract. An analogy is a relation which operates between two pairs
of terms representing two distant domains. It operates by transferring
meaning from a concept that is known to another that one would like to
clarify or define. In this report, we address analogy both from the
aspect of modeling and by automatically explaining it. We will then
propose a system of resolution of analogical equations in their notation
in symbol chains. The model, based on the common sense knowledge base
JeuxDeMots (a semantic network), operates by generating a list of
potential candidates from which it chooses the most suitable solution.
We conclude by evaluating our model on a collection of equations, and
reflecting upon future work.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-and-state-of-the-art">1 Introduction and state of
the art</h2>
<p>From more or less complex ideas and reasoning, eloquent and
persuasive expressions can emerge in a non-trivial way, carrying clear
or nuanced meanings. Language production and understanding are accepted
as faculties specific to humans, being capable of high-level semantic
interpretation. A speaker seems to refer, subconsciously and
effortlessly, to a complex and hierarchical apparatus built from his
knowledge of the world. We seek here to “achieve […] the formalization
of an operation that everyone recognizes as being at work in language”
[8] with the aim of automatizing it. Our main challenge is to carry out
such refined semantic reasoning automatically.</p>
<p>We can describe analogy as a fundamental way of expression used in
languages across the world [2]. Beyond this universality, the
omnipresence of analogies and metaphors in written language justifies
the interest of further research in the field. Manual annotation of
metaphorical figures from the British National Corpus revealed that 241
out of 761 sentences contained this type of language [9]. The study,
although marked by an idiomatic dimension specific to the English
language, represents an indicator of the prevalence of analogies in
natural language. However, these figures cannot a priori be generalized
to other languages.</p>
<p>It is important to underline the central character of the operation
of analogy in the human cognitive apparatus, whether in its fundamental
natural operations, or in more complex and methodical demonstrations and
reasoning (system 1/system 2 of Kahneman [5]). We are used to
approaching the resolution of a difficult or new problem by trying to
reduce it to another for which the solution is known. Hofstadter [3] [4]
believes that thought and analogy are inseparable, he argues that
analogy is the core of the cognitive functioning of human beings, and
that every problem we encounter is nothing other than an assembly of
analogies that we navigate more or less fluidly through our reasoning.
He thus bases his theories on this hypothesis of a close connection
between reasoning and analogy.</p>
<p>In this perspective, the interpretation of analogies represents a
crucial step forward in the development of work in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). In the ambitious perspective of identifying and then
analyzing this mechanism, it is crucial to scrutinize the subtleties of
language, and to analyze their functioning from cognitive and linguistic
points of view. A large part of the work in NLP still focuses on
elementary, or first level, linguistic tasks (morpho-syntactic labeling,
syntactic analysis, coreference resolution, recognition of named
entities, etc.), while another part of the research aims to improve
automatic inference mechanisms and the extraction of new knowledge from
textual corpora. Ultimately, even less work focuses on bringing together
the lessons and progress provided by each of these scientific
directions, in order to get closer to human linguistic capacity and thus
simulate high-level linguistic reasoning such as the understanding of
expressions in all their creativity.</p>
<p>In this work, we present a prototype for interpreting analogies by
exploiting a common sense knowledge base in the form of a graph, the
JeuxDeMots network (JDM) [7]. We will formalize statements in analogical
squares (see Section 2) and present methods for evaluating the quality
of these analogies (see Section 3). For an analogy, it is a question of
bringing out correspondences between terms which are provided to the
system by the user. The demonstrator of a first proof of concept
associated with this article is available at the following address:
https://analogie.demo.lirmm.fr</p>
<h2 id="analogy-square">2 Analogy square</h2>
<p>An analogy (when formalized in an analogy square) is a set of 4 terms
linked by similarity relationships (see Fig. 1). The strength of an
analogy comes from the similarity of the terms that compose it, its
explainability is based on the multiple relationships between these
terms.</p>

<h3 id="analogy-and-similarity">2.1 Analogy and similarity</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, figurative speech aims to integrate, into the
description of one concept, attributes of a second, chosen on the basis
of its semantic similarity with the concept described. Here, we tackle
the distinction between the two notions of similarity emanating from the
work of Gentner [1], who argues that there are at least two types of
similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Relational similarity, which consists of the correspondence
between the relations of two pairs of concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>Attributional similarity, which is the correspondence between the
attributes of two concepts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The notions of attribute and relation are accepted in the sense of
first-order logic, where an attribute is a single variable predicate,
while a relation is a predicate with two variables. We qualify two
terms, each designating a concept, as synonyms, when their attributional
similarity is sufficiently high, while we designate two pairs of terms
as analogous if their relational similarity is high [10].</p>
<p>We can, following this relational similarity, argue that it would be
possible to generate a correspondence (analogy) ( A B ) transferring
knowledge from a so-called source concept ( A ) to a target concept ( B
) . The source concept is generally abstract,uncertain or unknown,the
one on which we wish to establish an easy to understand and concrete
target. Here are examples of pairs of concepts constituting
analogies:</p>
<p>[ ]</p>
<p>[ ]</p>
<p>[ ]</p>
<p>The analogy (3) taken from the work of Turney and Pantel [11] could
be formulated: “the carpenter is to wood what the mason is to stone”.
The meanings of the relationships between the concepts mason and
carpenter respectively with stone and wood are indeed similar. On the
one hand, these are professions, and on the other hand, materials very
closely linked to these respective professions. The introduction of a
characteristic specific to the distant concept (source) therefore makes
available to the speaker all the contextual knowledge of the concept and
operates, in the case of an explanatory speech or reasoning, as a
familiar and edifying support, or, in the case of a poetic intention, as
an evocative agent helping to color the language and offering a
complementary lyrical richness.</p>
<h3 id="symbol-strings-and-analogy-equation">2.2 Symbol strings and
analogy equation</h3>
<p>When it comes to the notion of equality of relationships
(proportionality), between two pairs of terms(A,B)and(C,D),the statement
(3) can be written more concisely with a symbol chain notation ” ( A : B
: : C : D ) “. The notation illustrated by the example of the
proportional analogy between the pairs (carpenter, wood) and (mason,
stone) previously mentioned then becomes (4).</p>
<p>[ ]</p>
<p>The operator “:” indicates the existence of relational relationships
between its operands, in this case the terms carpenter and wood. The
“::” operator then transfers this relationship from the source to the
target by asserting the existence of a relationship of the same semantic
nature between the terms of the second pair (terms mason and stone).
This notation is adopted for its clear separation between the source
(carpenter and/or wood) and the target (mason and/or stone) in an
analogy.</p>

<p>Fig. 2. Behavior observed depending on the positioning of unknowns in
an analogy</p>
<!-- Media -->
<p>In the context of Aristotelian analogies, we find the case where one
(or more) of the four symbols is missing,raising what is called an
analogical equation of the form ” ( A : B : : C : ) ?“. The
interpretation of the analogy comes down to solving this equation and
consists of deducing the possible values of the missing term(s). In a
desire for formalism, similar to King and Gentner [6], we start from the
postulate that metaphors and comparisons can be formalized as
manifestations of gap analogies (analogical equations with 1 or 2
unknowns). Fig. 2 illustrates the different cases observed.</p>
<h2 id="strength-of-an-analogy-and-election-of-candidates">3 Strength of
an analogy and election of candidates</h2>
<p>Let us now see the methods proposed for the evaluation of
similarities with a view to electing the best candidate term(s) for
resolving a gap analogy.</p>
<h3 id="relationships-between-words">3.1 Relationships between
words</h3>
<p>We denote ” ( {ar}_ t{b}^{} ) ,the relation ( r ) of type ( t ) from
( a ) to ( b ) and its weight ” ( p( {a,r_ t,b}) ) “. In our knowledge
base, we have information about a term (or node in the context of a
knowledge graph): its relationships with other words. We exploit the
types of relationships present in ( {JD}{M}^{} ) and we limit ourselves
to those mainly relating to semantics: ( r ) _associated, ( r )
_d_amain, ( r ) _isa, ( r ) _anto, ( r ) _hypo, ( r ) _has_part, ( r )
_holo, ( r ) _agent, ( r ) _patient, ( r ) _lieu, ( r ) _instr, ( r )
_cara ( {c}^{2} ) .</p>
<p>We can group the relationships between terms/nodes ( A,B ) ,as
presented in Fig. 3,depending on whether they are direct or indirect
(with ( {iAB} ) nodes) as well as oriented in one direction or the
other. For a given relationship,it is possible to calculate a normalized
weight ( {p}<em>{} ) : the ratio of the weight of the relationship (
{ar}_ {tb} ) by the maximum weight of all relationships of type ( t )
from node ( a ) . The ( {p}</em>{} ) value makes it possible to classify
the relationships of a node and to select those considered to be the
most strongly associated,i.e. the first ( {3n} ) relationships with the
best normalized weights with regard to the type ( t ) of the
relationship. This allows us to control the combinational cost when
calculating the strength of similarities (see Section 3.2). The detailed
formula for the normalized weight for fixed ( a,r_ t ) and ( b ) is
defined in (5).</p>
<p>[{p}_{ - }( {a,r,b}) = ]</p>
<h3 id="relational-similarity">3.2 Relational similarity</h3>
<p>When analyzing an analogy ( A : B : : C : D ) ,we want to recover all
the direct and indirect relationships between ( A ) and ( B ) (in both
directions) as well as between ( C ) and ( D ) (in both directions). The
goal is then to perform an intersection between these types of
relationships between ( A ) and ( B ) on the one hand and ( C ) and ( D
) on the other hand in order to evaluate the strength of the relational
similarity.</p>

<p>Fig. 3. Notation of sets of direct and indirect relationships between
( A ) and ( B )</p>
<!-- Media -->
<p>In the example presented in Fig. 4, we see that we have the same
types of relationships between electron and nucleus/stone ( {}^{4} ) as
between planet and star. In this case,the relationships are indirect,
because no direct relations of the same type were found. We establish
the strength of the relational similarity observed when exploring from (
A ) to ( {B}^{ - } ) by averaging the normalized weights of the
relations from ( A ) to ( B ) combined with those from ( A ) to the
intermediate nodes ( {iAB} ) . For the relations from ( B ) to ( A ) ,we
operate the same way. In practice,the results are satisfactory in the
sense that the values obtained correspond to intuition, with the values
approaching 1 for a similarity considered strong. Similarly, the
similarity is considered weak when the calculated value approaches 0 .
It is equal to 0 when no relationship (direct or indirect) is observed.
Note that this measurement is taken as a baseline and can be refined to
improve precision.</p>
<p>We also implement some weighting according to the type of
relationship, which allows, for example,to consider a relationship of
the type ( r ) _isa, ( r ) _lieu or ( r ) _has_part as more important
with regard to its semantic contribution,relative to an ( r )
_associated relationship which is more vague 6 We hypothesize that
establishing a precise link between electron and nucleus then finding
this same link on the other side of the analogy between planet and star
(with other intermediate nodes) makes it possible to ensure the strength
of this relational similarity more than if it were a simple relation of
association of ideas or even if one did not exist.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p>4 The word ‘noyau’ in French has a translation of ‘stone’ as in the
hard core of stone fruits.</p>
<p>( {}^{5} ) Note that the strength of relational similarity from ( A )
to ( B ) is not necessarily the same as that fron ( A ) since there are
relationships oriented in both directions and of different weights</p>
<p>( {}^{6} ) In the future,we will be able to use a TF-IDF type
approach which consists of seeing how an ( {ArB} ) is as specific as
possible to ( A ) ,such an approach would however be computationally
intensive.</p>

<h3 id="attributional-similarity">3.3 Attributional similarity</h3>
<p>We now analyze the relationships of the same types between each of
the terms ( A,B ) and a certain intermediate node ( {iAB} ) . The
desired pattern therefore corresponds to ( {Ar}_ {tiAB} ) and ( {Br}_
{tiAB} ) . We proceed in the same way and independently with ( C ) and (
D ) . In Fig. 4,we see that there is no such intermediate node between
electron and planet in JDM, the attributional similarity is therefore
equal to 0 . This is not enough to assert that electron and planet have
nothing to do with each other, this rather means an absence of
attributional similarity from the point of view of the knowledge base in
its current state. On the other hand, we note between nucleus/stone and
star the presence of the swallow node via a relationship ( {r}<em>{ -
}{}</em>{-1} ) ,undoubtedly because a star can for example “be swallowed
by a black hole” and the stone of a fruit can “be swallowed by a child”
(stone and nucleus in french (noyau) being homonyms). A human speaker
will immediately notice that two different meanings of the word noyau
are involved. It will therefore be necessary to carry out semantic
refinements by distinguishing the different meanings of each word to
obtain better results; ( {JDM} ) is equipped to handle this type of word
sense disambiguation.</p>
<h3
id="overall-strength-and-election-of-candidates-in-the-case-of-metaphor">3.4
Overall strength and election of candidates in the case of metaphor</h3>
<p>An analogy is considered more meaningful when the relational and
attributional similarities it contains are sufficient, or from a
statistical point of view if their score is high. By taking an average?
between all of these similarities we obtain a value which we will
consider as a strength of association in the form of a probability. This
score takes on its meaning when it comes to classifying different
candidates in the case of a gap analogy. We can therefore evaluate the
relevance of these candidates by calculating the score for each of them
with the known nodes of the analogy with which they have sufficiently
high similarity ratios. Take for example the hole analogy leg : knee ::
arm : ?, the proposed candidate is elbow which corresponds to a response
that comes naturally. In our implementation,the relations ( {ar}_ {tb} )
displayed and currently used for calculating the weight are the first 2
in order of decreasing weight for each pair(a,b); this makes the
calculation times reasonable and gives satisfactory results for a proof
of concept.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation-of-analogy-equation-resolution">3.5 Evaluation of
analogy equation resolution</h3>
<p>We have a list of analogies with a distribution of responses provided
by JDM players (control) 9 . We check if the top 4 predicted candidates
include the best control term (see Fig. 5). This preliminary work
results in an accuracy of around ( {37}% ) . A perspective for
improvement consists,firstly,of taking into account a more covering set
of semantic relationships, and then calibrating the methods for
calculating similarities and their aggregations. It will be necessary to
put in place more in-depth procedures for exploring the knowledge base
such as inference and reasoning mechanisms. It is also possible to carry
out data preparation, such as morpho-syntactic normalization 10 or even
semantic disambiguation.</p>

<p>We believe that the strength of an analogy is defined through several
aspects. First of all, it should be noted that the approach does not
take place, with regard to the knowledge base, in a closed world
context, in the sense that a missing relation ar_ ( {tb} ) does not mean
that it’s not possible. Gaps in the knowledge base can result in
mistakes in the system’s analysis of the analogy. These gaps,
highlighted by mistakes, need to be identified and corrected. The
ongoing improvements of this proof of concept include, among other
things, more efficient reasoning mechanisms, and approaches to resolving
the polysemy of input terms.</p>
<p>In an analogical square, the relationships between words in the
source domain are of the same type (one could say analogous) to those in
the target domain establishing the strength of the relational
similarity. Equivalent terms from opposite domains must have a
relationship of the same type to an intermediate node (attribute). This
configuration is referred to as attributional similarity, which is key
to a better explanation of the analogy.</p>
<p>In any case, the more semantically precise the relation type, the
more useful that type is in explaining the analogy as a whole. The
overall strength of the analogy could correspond to the average of all
the relational and attributional similarities weights. This currently
makes it possible to elect the candidate(s) proving to be the most
appropriate for a given metaphor (a hole analogy with a single unknown)
in ( {37}% ) of cases with a simple algorithm (constituting our
baseline). However, a more precise aggregation of the different
similarity scores would make it possible to take into account the
nuances carried by each type of relationship; reason why the definition
of this aggregation method represents one of the central aspects of our
research. By definition, figurative language is subject to
interpretation; the same analogy or its explanation can turn out to be
more or less telling depending on the angle from which the explanation
is approached. The goal of an automatic analyzer is to highlight what
can most be considered a convincing or satisfactory interpretation
(subjective concepts) for a given analogy. In the state of the art, it
should be noted that the subject is often treated through theoretical
and linguistic points of view rather than in computational and applied
work.</p>
<p>This work aims to produce a resolution model but will also serve as a
tool for identifying anomalies in the knowledge base (imperfect and
incomplete by nature). Any shortcomings will be highlighted by cases of
algorithm failure and will make it possible to consolidate the
appropriate types of relationships. One avenue for future research could
then be to design a game (with a purpose) on the intersections of
associations to broaden the knowledge base in this regard.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-future-work">5 Conclusions and future work</h2>
<p>We have presented our work on the automated treatment of metaphors
and analogies in natural language, using the knowledge graph of
JeuxDeMots to generate plausible solution, and providing a prototype
solver. We have also presented some promising preliminary results of our
approach.</p>
<p>In the future, we will first extend our approach to incorporate word
sense disambiguation, then look at different methods for detecting and
resolving metaphors in their linguistic context.</p>
