Putting the diagrams together has been one of the most challenging tasks I have ever attempted.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Toward that end, I would like to thank my Montana State University-Northern colleagues whom I made listen to me think out loud while looking at all those beginning diagrams. When they started running away when they saw me, I feared I had gone too far! Such is life. I would also like to thank my MSU-N students who learned the diagrams with me in my Introduction to Brain-Compatible Learning class, added their own thoughts and perspectives and helped me get those diagrams into this final (for now) form.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="8" id="mark-858423a7-4b28-4935-956d-6e3fd785efb3" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Any book writing is a journey. I would like to thank my son Ben for being such an amazing collaborator. While the ideas are mostly mine, the vast majority of the words are his - and I like how they fall. Thank you, Ben, for all your time, effort, and work on this project.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>A big-shout out also goes to Matthew Mitchell, who contributed all the diagrams you will see in the book. He was able to take my ideas and make them look presentable-no small feat!!</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>As always I would also like to give a shout-out to my wife, Jeanne-she is wonderful. Her support, insights, and listening skills help keep me focused on what really matters.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="9" id="mark-c2fef5ae-0008-4470-a0db-82d8905972bd" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>INTRODUCTION</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>I once took a graduate-level teaching class where we learned how to respond to students' answers: correct answers, partially correct answers, and just plain wrong answers. We learned how to use wait time, how to call on different students and how to ask "higher-order questions." Those were all good things to know and I have used most of those strategies from that point on in my classrooms.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The fact of the matter is that most teachers ask their students lots of questions - and most of those questions are fact based (content oriented). We ask content-based questions because we think it increases student learning and engagement; we want to see if they have read (and understood) the material; it is how we went through school; we know how to organize our teaching around that strategy; and isn't that what the Socratic Method is?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>We've learned a lot about how the brain works since I took that class oh so many years ago. We know about the structures of the brain (right and left as well as front and back), multiple intelligences, the way that facts are stored, and cognitive belief systems. We also know about Bloom's Taxonomy, higher-order thinking skills and some developmental features of intellect.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>And yet, it's still unclear how to teach students to "think" (Merriam-Webster, 2002), defined as "to use one's mind actively to form connected ideas." Content is king. We can see it in our tests (classroom and standardized), our grading, and the types of reading material we assign. Most schooling is fact based, and most teachers have little conceptual knowledge of what makes a higher-order thinking question more complex than a run-of-the-mill content-based question.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="10" id="mark-288af8b6-95d5-45fd-9b9d-b8a8a8d35e0f" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>And most teachers feel it. They might question the relevance of all these facts: How important is it really to know that Helena is the capital of Montana? I mean really, in the grand scheme of things? Not knowing "why" is uncomfortable, sure, but what's the alternative? In many schools, there isn't one: Resources are limited, time is limited, and no one is getting paid for being a revolutionary.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The problem is, it's not clear and explicit what questions make students actually think for themselves. Furthermore, 1) it isn't clear how certain questions make students think, nor 2) what type of thinking is required of students to answer certain types of questions. Without some nuanced answers to these questions, it's just plain easier to teach content.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Easier, yes, but if the real focus of teaching is student "learning" (defined in Merriam-Webster [2002] as a "change in thoughts, beliefs or actions"), teaching for only content fact accumulation falls far short of our goal. We have to provide students the opportunities to practice "thinking," and do so in an environment where failure is not high stakes. We have to develop their habits of mind. This requires us to be Explicit and Intentional about student "thinking"!</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Teaching thinking is also a relevance issue. Memorization by itself isn't relevant. We have access to more facts than we can handle with a click of a mouse or the swipe of an index finger. Memorizing facts doesn't improve your quality of life (in the long term anyway), but improving your ability to think, or being able to think in different ways does. My (Ben talking here) high school math teacher used to say, "Are you going to walk around on the street with a calculator in your pocket?" I wonder if he ever imagined that the answer would be a resounding, "YES!"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The reality of our present world is different than we imagined, and memorization is taking a backseat to processing and connecting information and ideas. Being able to think increases your chances of workable/success-oriented solutions. Making thinking the focus of classrooms allows students to replace their current patterns (of thought, belief, or actions) with patterns that may be more effective in meeting their needs.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>This book is unique not because it identifies higher-order thinking skills, but because it models thinking using a progressively complex series of diagrams which make "thinking" Explicit. We can intentionally teach thinking because it is explicit (and therefore measurable). By making thinking explicit, we can teach certain types of thinking "Intentionally." These diagrams allow us to Plan, and Re-meditate, student misunderstandings when they occur, right then and there with a strategy grounded in success.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="11" id="mark-f2fcc746-053f-4ded-aebb-2e24d74bddf0" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Learning is a hugely personal process. Teachers know they can't make anyone learn anything if the learner doesn't want to. But when we teach "thinking" explicitly, we empower our students to improve their lives and (a key point of this book) make ourselves dispensable.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>This book is organized into five parts. Part I explains big-picture ideas: the Knowledge, Skills, and Dispositions of teaching Thinking Questions (TQ), as well as issues of relevance. Part I does not include any diagrams (just hold your horses). Part II introduces the simplest set of diagrams and focuses on experiences in general and their formation and structure. This is where thinking begins. Part III offers advanced higher-thinking skills which focus on illuminating past experiences. Part IV offers examples into how thinking looks with a future orientation. Part V talks about the complex issue of "planning for student learning" with the Thinking Questions in mind.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>So imagine this book as a Master Teacher's Education Class. We will follow a teacher (Mr. James) and some of his students as they explore thinking and Thinking Questions (TQs). We will connect the Knowledge, Skills and Dispositions of teaching thinking - and then start at the beginning of how we come to know things. Creating the Art of Teaching Thinking is a journey-so grab that handrail and hold on for the ride! ❶</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="12" id="mark-0596a86a-a5a7-4a31-b299-cd7f8f352daf" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>WHY THINKING QUESTIONS?</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Before we talk about teaching thinking, we should first think a little about what "thinking" is. Merriam-Webster (2002) says that thinking is "to believe that something is true, that a particular situation exists, that something will happen, etc." or "to have an opinion about something or to form or have a thought in your mind."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>That's a solid place to start. That is, after all, what we hope to accomplish-we want students to form their own opinions, to have a broad world-view, to consider cause and effect, to have thoughts. But how do you teach that? How do you bridge the gap between presenting content and student thinking? Bloom's Taxonomy identifies some higher-order thinking skills:</div></div></div><div><br><ul><li>Knowledge/Remembering</li></ul><br><ul><li>Comprehension/Understanding</li></ul><br><ul><li>Application</li></ul><br><ul><li>Analysis</li></ul><br><ul><li>Evaluation</li></ul><br><ul><li>Synthesis/Creating</li></ul><br></div><div><div><div>These are the different "ways" to think, all of which are useful terms and a great place to start. But the problem isn't really knowing which higher-order thinking skills to teach: The question is how. How do you teach synthesis? Or analysis, or evaluation? How do you make "thinking" in those ways Explicit and Intentional?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="13" id="mark-1de4c510-dc4f-499d-946c-36df421107e5" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>P A R T I</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For example, how do you "teach" students to Summarize (a comprehension question)? Or Interpret (an analysis question)? Or Categorize (a synthesis question)? Or even Judge (an evaluation question)? We can (and frequently do) ask these types of questions—but “teach” students to think in those ways? Not usually-mostly because we do not have a framework for understanding how the brain needs to work in order to answer those questions.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>So with that in mind, why Thinking Questions (TQ)? We live in an information-rich environment where facts can be accessed/gathered almost instantaneously. Recalling or having access to the facts of a content area is different than understanding how to use them or how they work together to create understanding.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Knowing facts is not "thinking," just like listing the titles of the "100 Best Movies" does not make you a cinematographer. Thinking (rather than memorizing) requires that the learner DO something with the information. At the deepest level thinking connects what you know (knowledge) with what you can do (skills) to why you choose to do it (dispositions).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Ben's Story: Last summer I was asked to audition for a musical. At the audition, they asked how much singing experience I had (a little) and whether I could tap dance (not at all). But I'd played soccer for many years and I've always liked to learn new physical skills, so I learned a small section of a dance, laughed, had some fun, and left the audition thinking I'd probably be offered a small ensemble role. The next day I was offered the lead.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>It turns out, what had impressed the choreographer wasn't my skill or knowledge, but my dispositions-my attitude.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Knowledge-how to tap dance-very little to none at all!</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Skill-tap dancing itself-no!</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Disposition-willingness to practice and learn the knowledge and skills-absolutely!!!</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>So what might knowledge, skills and dispositions look like in the classroom? Part I introduces Rachel, Ramone, Jack, and Sarah, and their American history teacher, Mr. James, who teaches using Thinking Questions.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>It's the first day of a new American history class. Rachel, Ra-mone, Jack, and Sarah are sitting with their friends and classmates waiting for the first bell.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="14" id="mark-629bb507-24fe-4276-bd7b-92b7d975aaa4" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel is a straight-A student with her eyes set on a top college. Ramone is a good student when he wants to be, but he'd rather be out on the football field with his friends and coaches. Jack loves history; he owns several historically accurate computer games and knows all of the big names from each period. Sarah is creative and outgoing-she's thinking about pursuing theatre after she graduates from high school.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>But right now, they're all a little nervous; Mr. James is rumored to be tough; other students say that the work is hard, but that they learned a lot, whatever that means.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James gets to the room right as the bell rings. He sets his stuff down and says: "Hey there, everyone, welcome to American history. Our first unit is going to be on the Civil War."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Great," Ramone thinks, "another unit about dead white guys. I hope homework from this class doesn't cut into practice."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"We're going to be using the content from that time period to develop our understanding of different perspectives on the same experience . . ."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel thinks, "This doesn't sound like it's going to be on the AP test . . . is it too late to drop this class?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"... We'll be studying the Civil War and the different perspectives in an attempt to understand the human experience of 'conflict' and how the same event can be interpreted in many different ways. You'll be given 'characters,' who may or may not have actually existed, to role play."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Jack thinks, "What's the point? Facts are facts. I already know all about the Civil War."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"... The final project will be a 15-minute video that you'll write and direct yourselves, about a situation in which your characters might have interacted."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Yes," Sarah thinks, "I love improv. I'll just make it up as I go along.”</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Your final product will be shown to the community. In the past, we've had parents, grandparents, administrators, and siblings attend-it's usually a pretty big group that comes out to see the</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="15" id="mark-1bff3669-8e63-48b6-bc46-f834837b0130" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>P A R T I</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>pieces you'll be creating. Any questions? No? All right," Mr. James finishes, "Let's get to work."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James has been using Teaching Questions to teach this class for a couple of years, even though it means a lot of work and flexibility on his part. The Thinking Questions that Mr. James is going to ask in this unit will:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Ask students to synthesize what they think they already know along with new information that he will provide;</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Allow the students to figure out an answer(s) for themselves (they will have to Re-view what they think they know and create a brand-new answer);</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Allow for a spectrum of answers (Some answers will be `"Righter"` or `"Wronger."` Robust `"thinking"` will include qualifiers such as `"if ..."` or `"then . . . "`);</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">Have multiple `"right"` answers, as long as the rationale makes sense. Much higher-order thinking is based upon life experiences-with different experiences come different answers (that may still be correct); and</li></ol><br><ol><li value="5">Elicit answers that are content rich and concept focused-students will use content to answer questions rather than just naming content facts.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>The answers to TQs are ultimately experience based; when students explain their reasoning, they will eventually reference some prior, personal experience.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking questions matter because they empower the learner to use and access more and more information, to view their past experiences as both powerful and limiting, and to develop "habits of mind" which will increase the quality of their lives (both today and in the future).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>When students think, they connect their classroom learning to their lives outside of school, they connect multiple facts into a larger concept, and they become comfortable considering long-term goals and ideas. Caring about teaching thinking shows that you care about your students as human beings.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Students are ready and waiting for someone to lead them with joy and enthusiasm toward a relevant end-in-mind. They hope that their teacher has: the knowledge of why it matters, the skills to show how it is done and the dispositions to choose to model complex personal thinking for them on a daily basis.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="16" id="mark-f26ded91-e061-48c6-bbd9-6c10ef64215e" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>But teaching thinking is difficult, and because of its dynamic nature may be considered an "art," and an artist never ceases to refine their technique.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Facts are not knowledge-knowledge is the personal spin a person puts on how those facts are related and construct a specific concept. Similarly, you can't teach thinking out of a can. You can't look it up on your smart-phone. You have to dance with the facts, paint with the students' prior experiences, sing with the students' assumptions (which could be wrong or very limited), and sculpt with how everything is informed by their belief systems.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking is a creative endeavor, whether you're teaching it or learning it.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>This first part is divided into four chapters, all focused on the students as they tackle the big-picture issues. Chapter 1 follows Rachel as she learns about Thinking Question dispositions (the habits of mind that thinkers tend to have). In chapter 2, Jack begins connecting knowledge to symbols in an attempt to model different types of thinking and puts a purpose to thinking in specific ways. In chapter 3, Sara learns TQ skills, such as the use of cue words in questions. Finally in chapter 4, Ramone struggles with the eternal question, "Why do I have to know this?"</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="17" id="mark-34ea3ab7-e5e0-4d3d-be4e-d008386bc1e2" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><span style="display: inline;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>❶ RACHEL'S STORY Questions of Dispositions</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel's Story: Rachel is a great student. She does her assignments well and turns them in on time. She understands how the system works and checks all of the boxes. She understands that some students aren't as smart as she is-that's OK. She never really minds compensating for a poor group member every now and again. It's not their fault. But she doesn't understand how a student can be "smart" and still get Bs and Cs. Why don't they just do the work?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James' class is beginning to give her real trouble. She is worried that she won’t have all of the answers for the questions on the upcoming <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="0" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D434 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D443 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi>A</mi><mi>P</mi></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> test. They seem to be moving soooooo slowly, and none of her answers seem to be "right" or "wrong." How is she supposed to know any of the answers? She goes in to talk to him about her frustrations.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James is grading their most recent research papers when Rachel walks in. She sits down and asks, "Mr. James, I feel like I'm not learning enough to pass the <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="1" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D434 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D443 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi>A</mi><mi>P</mi></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> test. When are we going to start learning?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James puts the papers down and sits back. Then he asks, "Rachel, you're a very good student, and I know this class is hard for you. So let me ask you a question: 'What is the point of a good education?'"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"What do you mean?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>“I mean, why do you come to school? What do you expect to get out of this?”</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>“I don’t know. I want to get into a good college.”</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"And after that? A good job? And after that, what?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"I don't really know." One of the dilemmas in American education is that educators have no clear and agreed-upon purpose for what we are to accomplish. Everyone has their own ideas and therefore we lack a common focus as to our purpose. Is it to get students into a top college, as Rachel thinks, for better job prospects and more money? Is it to prepare students for the workforce (business would like this one!), to teach technical skills and vocabulary? These are both very marketable options, and could appeal to many students.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="18" id="mark-0bae53a3-0f28-463f-87b3-6a948615bb77" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>But does that apply to all students? What about the other students? The ones that aren't going to be going to Fortune 500 companies, who don't want to go to college? What about the stay-at-home parents, the self-starters, or the students that just don't know what they want yet? What's the point of an education for them? Shouldn't the goal of education be a little broader than preparing for a job and/or career?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>In this book, the purpose of education is to "create self-actualized participants in a democratic society" (Kolis, 2011). Not only does the goal of self-actualization mean educating everyone, no matter where or who they are, but making this purpose clear and explicit would mean that our schools would help students develop lasting habits of mind and body rather than memorize trivia.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Much has been written on the topic of self-actualization, too much to do more than give a brief overview here. An education system focusing on helping students work toward self-actualization would allow students to:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Focus on continually `"enhancing your quality of life"` - a reflective and goal-focused habit.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Live with your passion in mind-makes hard work purposeful rather than drudgery.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Own your own learning-no excuses or blame.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">Know your strengths and weaknesses-keep those strengths and work on those weaknesses.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="5">Create and follow personal visions and goals-being purpose driven.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="6">Transfer learning from one context to another-see the connections between the pieces.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="7">Figure out stuff for yourself (options/choices), as rationally as possible, and</li></ol><br><ol><li value="8">Contribute to others and society-the moral imperative of learning.</li></ol></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="19" id="mark-b484a38c-ca54-4cb3-ba95-8f66c60d4573" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Fully self-actualized individuals would indeed behave with those ends in mind. The dilemma is if one teacher or one class could teach self-actualization, there would be little need for the 13 years of required education-even then, could we expect students to achieve this state at the age of 18 ? Of course not. Few people ever become self-actualized. You can't teach self-actualization: It's too big and too personal.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>You can, however, interact with your students' Dispositions (actually, you begin to interact with their dispositions as soon as you sit in the same room with them). Dispositions are the lever by which a small amount of work can cause enormous changes.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Dispositions are the tendencies to think, believe and act in certain ways under certain circumstances (Merriam-Webster, 2002). They are the patterns of how someone chooses to think, the actions (or inactions) they take, and/or the extensions of what they most deeply believe.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>There is a quote that describes dispositions perfectly: "You will always act in accordance with your deepest beliefs."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>If you are unsure what your dispositions are, examine how you behave. Look to see where you spend your time, effort and resources (to meet your needs/be successful). That includes the things you say, the things you think but don't say, the things you buy, where you spend your time (at work and in play), and what skills you practice. Since everything you do is a choice (Glasser, 1998), your choices demonstrate to everyone what you truly care about-your tendency to act in certain ways under certain conditions.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Ultimately, your dispositions emerge from your deepest beliefs. Your dispositions are where the rubber meets the road; you can tell yourself whatever you want, but if you don't act in accordance with your beliefs, you don't really believe what you think you do. If you think and behave like a bad person, it doesn't matter what you believe about yourself: You are a bad person. You always act congruently with what you truly believe (even when you are unaware of those deep beliefs). And since learning is always a personal choice, the knowledge you have and the skills you chose to develop are extensions of those beliefs.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mickey's Story: I love to bird hunt (or take a walk with my dog in some wild place with a gun. If I happen to shoot something, fine. If I don't, it's still fine). That means I have a hunting dog (and that means money). I have to create the time to go hunting (a time issue) and I had to learn about the birds in this area, places to actually hunt, seasons, bird habitat... I have had to prioritize my time, efforts and resources to do what I love. Those are all indicators of multiple beliefs: a conservationist viewpoint, a wellness belief and a belief that I can learn what I want to learn.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="20" id="mark-35ab884b-af8d-4c76-a41a-1a5e418bcded" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Focusing on teaching dispositions means to realize that individual learning is always a personal choice. The best any teacher can do is to provide experiences, thoughts and other perspectives in an environment where the learner is willing to consider learning (changing).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James: "So, Rachel, what do you think your dispositions are? In what ways do you tend to act? What do you believe?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel is quiet, thinking. Finally she says, "I think that, maybe, I think there's a right and a wrong answer to everything. I get frustrated when I don't have a clear answer."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James: "That's a good place to begin-personal knowledge is important. With this class, I'm trying to teach you to learn on top of the knowledge. Is knowing the 'correct' answer learning? I mean, does memorizing the answers change how you think or behave?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Learning" (defined) is a change in thoughts, beliefs, or actions (Merriam-Webster, 2002). Without some sort of change, learning hasn't taken place. If students do not choose to use anything they have "learned" in the classroom in their lives outside the school setting, what have they spent all their time doing?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Consider this: If your students don't "tend to act" (have this particular disposition) like learners, what are the chances they'll make meaningful connections between their "real lives" and the classroom? If, however, you can present the right opportunities and experiences, a chance to be curious and try new things in a low-risk environment, you might be able to change "how they tend to act" in real life.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>And being a learner is important. If someone "wants" to learn something, they are willing to give of their time, effort and resources to learn that thing-always. Interacting (successfully) with your students on the dispositions level allows you to help them make lasting changes in their lives.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="21" id="mark-b12d70ad-ddde-456d-9a99-3f32b08ab4c8" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>So when we teach students "Thinking Questions," we are trying to help them change their dispositions (the way they tend to act). Just like in every discipline, there are specific dispositions that Thinking Questions tend to stress. Thinking Question dispositions include a willingness:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">To Re-think what you know, believe and can do in the face of new experiences, facts or alternative beliefs;</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">To search for multiple right answers;</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">To seek out and use expert-level criteria when making important decisions;</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">To exhibit an action-orientation; and</li></ol><br><ol><li value="5">To view other people's experiences as creative opportunities.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>When teaching students to "think" explicitly, the idea is to help them replace their current thoughts, beliefs and actions with habits that are more nuanced, complex, sophisticated, robust, thoughtful, and holistic. Everyone is acting in ways they believe best meet their needs-even when life consequences show them otherwise. They need other thoughts, other ideas and other actions to change the outcomes - and they need help "learning" to make more effective decisions.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The point of "thinking" (aligned with purpose of education) is to "create self-actualized participants in a democratic society." Students are not our prisoners when it comes to learning-they, and only they, decide what they learn (change) based upon personal "thinking," and a focus on teaching dispositions allows for the greatest "learning."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel: "OK . . . I guess. But what about the AP test?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James: "I know you're stressed about the test, and I know that change isn't easy. It sounds like you feel like I'm teaching learning instead of teaching history-would that be accurate?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel: "Yeah, I mean the test isn't going to ask me the same things you're asking me. I just don't see how it could help."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James: "OK. Tell you what: give me a month to convince you that this is valuable, that you can 'learn' history and get all the information you need to pass the test. That in fact, the two things go hand in hand. Can you give me that? If at the end of the month you feel like you're not getting the information, I'll make you a personal study guide for every unit."</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="22" id="mark-0befe2f6-03ec-442e-821f-e57060a101e2" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel: "OK. I guess so."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James gets up and opens the door for Rachel. "Thanks for stopping by. Keep asking questions-it helps keep me honest."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Trusting someone to put you in situations where you can actually learn something important is tough; you're trusting another person with your successes and failures, your whole future self. Yes, focusing on dispositions is risky-but on the other hand, so is continued failure or continuing to do the same thing over and over again in a rapidly changing world. Focusing on teaching dispositions is the lever for helping people come to understand that they control their lives.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>In chapter 2 we meet Jack, who is a self-proclaimed "expert" on the Civil War. ❷</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="23" id="mark-fc92101f-d478-413e-b4eb-10b0a2d5f527" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>JACK'S STORY Questions of Knowledge</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>While memorizing content is not the goal of Thinking Questions, content matters because thinking requires something to think about - and in most classrooms and learning opportunities that includes content. But if our education is going to act toward a purpose (the big picture/purpose being self-actualization, the small picture/goal being changing the way students tend to act in each discipline), we need to educate on three fronts, not just content (knowledge).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>We need to teach Dispositions (we talked about that last chapter), Knowledge (this chapter), and Skills (next chapter), in discipline-specific ways. This chapter is about the Knowledge prong of our three-prong attack.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Jack's Story: Jack thinks of himself as a Civil War enthusiast. He knows the dates for all the important events and has a head for names. It's just one of the things that he's really good at. He also loves Civil War historical fiction, where fictional characters interact with real historical figures, and he loves picking out factual errors that other students make and adding obscure or little-known facts about the topics Mr. James is teaching about.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Sometimes just as Jack is about to offer more specific information, Mr. James will move on-even if the information is relevant (to Jack). Doesn't Mr. James want his students to know all this neat stuff? Rachel said that her meeting with Mr. James helped, so as Mr. James is locking his door before going home, Jack ambushes him.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Jack pounces: "Hey, Mr. James-can I ask a quick question about class?"</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="24" id="mark-8e430a3e-9de5-4fb8-bad6-c962226ba6c1" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James looks at his watch, and says, "Sure, Jack, what's up?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>“It just seems like we skip over a bunch of stuff. I love the Civil War, and I know that we're not getting super in depth with everything - there's a bunch of stuff that you're not talking about that's really interesting; are we ever going to talk about all those things?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James unlocks his door and turns on the lights, saying, "Good question. Come on in. Let's sit for a minute. The simple answer is, yes, we probably will. The more complex answer is that we have some other big concepts to talk about in combination with all those facts and stories. Now let me ask you a question: Is the information that we're talking about in class-just the information-different or better or worse than the information that you can get online?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"I guess it's about the same."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"You're right, of course-but my job isn't just to communicate facts. My job is to teach you how to think-actually think-in a discipline-specific way, which is different than being a storyteller or a fact-checker. Do you see what I mean?”</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Knowledge is important. Having the discipline-specific facts is what allows teachers to communicate content to their students, and what allows professionals to communicate with other professionals, and students to pass standardized tests. Consider "teacher-proof" courses, classes designed like a cookbook so every teacher achieves a standard result: students that "know" the specific facts. For many teachers, this is fine. It's easier to teach the content and only the content.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>But facts only help people learn (change how they think, believe, or act) if those people know how to think.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Being a TQ teacher implies more than knowing facts related to your discipline; it means knowing how to convey those facts to others in ways that will enhance their lives. Science teachers must know science facts as well as know how to teach science so that the entire process improves student's lives. History teachers must be students of history and know how to teach history in ways that make history relevant. It's also why many colleges and universities don't require their faculty to have teaching degrees; by the time a student gets to college, the assumption/expectation is that students should have the thinking and learning thing down.

It was a fantastic weekend!"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James responds, "Nice. Reenactments are cool because you get to use all the information you've learned as well as give you a reason to learn more information."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Knowledge is useful (and worth remembering) when you put it to use. Measuring matters when you are building something, cooking something or making something to scale. Theory matters when you have to fix something on your own.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="27" id="mark-d634a042-d455-46f6-9cd6-ed0ec99dc963" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><span style="display: inline;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>A good bike mechanic knows all the components of a bike.

All models are too simplistic; they lack scale and depth and connections between the pieces. Letters, numbers, signs, shapes, and music notes are representations, not reality. The letters <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="2" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D451 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mo class="mjx-n" space="2"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2026"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-mi class="mjx-i" space="2"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D45C TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mo class="mjx-n" space="2"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2026"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-mi class="mjx-i" space="2"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D454 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>d</mi><mo>…</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>…</mo><mi>g</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> are just that - three letters that we use to represent a living thing-a dog.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>And what they represent is always personal. Your understanding and perspective of "dog" is different than mine. That means everyone has their own "working definition" for almost any concept (flavored by our personal experiences). So we say the same thing, and think we are in agreement when in reality we have totally different working definitions of the same concept.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>While symbols are not the real thing, they do allow us a beginning point in understanding how complex a question is for our students (in terms of thinking, prior experiences and future thinking). They provide a beginning point for 1) thinking, 2) planning, and 3) assessments.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Diagrams (models) also show the big picture-and how the little pieces fit. They are the diagram in the "instructions" along with the step-by-step written words. The importance of diagrams is apparent for anyone who's purchased anything from Ikea (I'd have no stable furniture were it not for those drawings upon those flimsy pieces of paper).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>An explicit symbol (picture) of what thinking entails also provides a strategy for dealing with and understanding "wrong" answers. It allows us to find out where the learner got lost (what they are really thinking) and how to help them Re-think what they know (everyone is responsible for their own understanding). Thinking "incorrectly" does in fact matter, either right now or at some point in the future.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Models help students visualize their own "thinking," and that helps them own their own learning. Thinking itself is developmental; we are all limited and blessed by our experiences, our genetic abilities and our developmental learning trajectory. Seeing thinking allows people to decide for themselves if there might be other, more productive ways of thinking.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="28" id="mark-b902183e-aaea-4b12-8ff3-2e44168103dd" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>One strength of a developmental outlook is that since we come back to the same big ideas over and over again, not everything has to be "perfect" at that time and place. We grow into our understandings.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mickey's Story: When our oldest son was in first grade he had a wonderful teacher. During our first meeting with her she talked about how to be supportive when helping our son learn to write.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>She used the word "temporary" (versus "inventive") spelling. She liked that term better because many adults were getting hung up on that "inventive" term—they did not want their child to “invent” spellings that were wrong.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Temporary" also means developmentally appropriate. There is a time and place for certain kinds of tasks. And as they grow over time (developmentally) they would grow into correct spellings.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>She was right on the mark and her students were not overwhelmed with developmentally inappropriate details!</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The idea of coming back to the same idea over and over again (each time adding more complex and more specific information) is called scaffolding. Scaffolding works as a curriculum model because it removes some common assumptions when it comes to learning: 1) Not everything has to be totally right at every moment in time-it just has to be developmentally appropriate (for now); 2) not all information has to be taught all at once-the big (important) ideas in every field crop up time after time; and 3) just because we love the details does not make them relevant to our students.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking is complex business, but just saying something is complex is not very helpful (either you "get it" or you don't) and certainly not learn-ingful. Thinking in certain ways is also a pattern and the more complex the thinking, the more it benefits everyone when the complexity is acknowledged and made explicit. Models (diagrams) are one "tool" that we can use to empower students to "think" for themselves.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>In our next chapter we meet Sarah who knows how to play the schooling game, but doesn't take much seriously. ❸</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="29" id="mark-8935c225-c1b6-4585-a125-e2222e861983" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>SARAH'S STORY Questions of Skills</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Sarah's Story: Sarah is a performer through and through. She is loud and funny, and loves being the center of attention. Both students and teachers like her, and she can often get by without giving her all because she's so quick witted and likable. She's an OK student and she's OK with it-she enjoys school because that's where all of her friends are. She is known to say things like, "Cs get degrees.”</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>On this particular day, Sara and the rest of the class are working on the question, "What are some common characteristics between the way all wars begin?" (an analysis thinking question). Mr. James is taking down their suggestions on the board. Ramone has just come up with "economic pressure," when Sarah raises her hand and calls out:</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>“MR. JAMES, I’M SO BORED. WE ALREADY KNOW ALL OF THIS.”</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The class laughs, and Mr. James laughs and says, "I get the feeling you're trying to tell me something. You guys feel like you know the content pretty well?" The class mumbles an affirmative except for a "YES!" from Sarah. “OK, Sarah, now you’ve done it. You’ve drawn my ire. Question time. You know the material; that's great. Sarah, what are the things you have to know when you're about to go into a performance?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"You have to know your lines and your blocking,"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>“OK, great, and what do you have to be able to DO? As in, what skills make it possible to perform your lines and blocking?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"You mean, like projecting and being able to speak clearly?"</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="30" id="mark-0a2925aa-44bf-4d0a-a66e-116911b56dc2" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>"Right. That's what we're working on right now: You guys have the content down-your lines are memorized, and you've written down your blocking. Now we're working on our skills. Except instead of theatre, we're talking about thinking. And how do you sharpen your skills? Ramone, what do you think? How do you sharpen your skills?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Ramone is a little startled to be dragged into the discussion. "I don't know."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James: "Oh, you don't, do you? Where do you go after school every day?”</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Ramone: “Uh, practice.” He gets it. “Oh.”</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James: "And why do you practice so much?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Ramone is smiling now. "You practice so you don't have to think about doing whatever you're practicing. Coach says that you don't even start to really enjoy playing the game until you stop having to think about your body doing its job."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>“That’s what I think too,” says Mr. James.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>A professional in any discipline has skills, which are defined by Merriam-Webster (2002) as "the ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance." Skills are the enactment of knowledge (if the knowledge is explicit). This blending of knowledge and skill is the difference between a worker, a craftsman and an artist-in any field.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Skills don't arise spontaneously out of knowledge. Rather, they are the result of practice, repetition, and trial and error. You don't become an artist without laborious development of sculpting technique, and you don't become a thinker without practice and repetition.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking Questions (TQs) ask the learner to think in specific ways for a particular purpose (a specific end-in-mind). These thinking skills, just like the tools of any trade, have names, are specific, and are most effective when they're used in the correct circumstances.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Each Thinking Question requires the use of a specific cue word for the task at hand and each TQ is based upon prior TQs as well as the foundation for those yet to come (a systems point of view). We'll go over the specific skills in the upcoming chapters.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Answering TQs requires a specific set of skills, but so does constructing and asking them. Students won't use thinking skills at all, let alone the correct ones, if the teacher doesn't know how to elicit them.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="31" id="mark-ea898e6f-f151-45a9-a92f-23f4b8324c3e" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>All Thinking Questions share specific characteristics (the skills of the TQs):</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">They are all open-ended questions. That means there are multiple correct responses (some of course more correct than others).</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">They each use a `"cue word"` which specifies the type of thinking that is being required. Change the cue word and you change the TQ! (There is a big difference between `"list the pieces"` and `"rank the pieces."`)</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Student answers provide the `"data"` to know if you can move on or need to Re-visit prior thinking.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Learning the skills of asking TQs allows the teacher to create Thinking Questions Intentionally and Explicitly to meet a learning goal (remember the definition of learning-a change in thought, beliefs or action). The right TQs in the right sequence helps everyone in the class become more explicit about their thinking and even allows for students to help each other-when help is needed.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Asking TQs requires a degree of intentionality and explicitness that must be practiced and is not usually seen in most classrooms. If we teach (and students learn) the knowledge, skills and dispositions of the TQs, they will be prepared for the "How's" and "What's" of life. Thinking is not random, not happenstance, and not serendipity, which means it can be practiced and improved.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>One powerful end-in-mind for great teachers, parents, coaches and mentors is to empower others in such a way as to make themselves dispensable! The point of Thinking Diagrams is to empower our learners to meet their own needs (in a rapidly changing world). That requires skills (rather than hope)!</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Teaching (and learning) is a lifelong process. Not everything has to be taught all at once. What matters is to teach skills and knowledge and the dispositions—in age (and experience) appropriate ways.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Skills are specific; it's clear when someone does it well, and you see the change in behavior right now. That also makes them easy to assess. Complexity lies in that skills lead somewhere-they are not that important all unto themselves. Skills are important because when a bunch of small skills are combined, they allow you to DO something interesting and complex.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="32" id="mark-7ca4b2d1-ad20-4ca2-be1c-5279b510db73" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Finally, in the next chapter we meet Ramone, who asks the most challenging teacher question of all: "Why do I have to know this stuff?"</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="33" id="mark-fa7c4e11-05b3-477d-9990-d6e208a77e6e" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>❹ RAMONE'S STORY Questions of Relevance</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Ramone's Story: Ramone plays football. He's really good, and gets most of what he needs from the team. His coaches are his mentors and role models; most of his friends are on the team and they talk about football all the time. The team encourages him to keep his grades up (otherwise he can't play) and if he does well enough in the next two seasons he might even get some money to go to college. He mostly tries to do his school work and keep his head down. He grew up next door to Sarah, one of the few friends he has outside of football.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James finishes talking about skills and looks around.

"I just don't know when I'm going to use any of this, you know?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"What do you mean, Ramone?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>“Well, I mean, I get like practicing skills in football; you practice to get better so you can win. I'm not going to be a historian and I don't even really like history, so I don't really know why I have to know this."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Ahh," says Mr. James, "now that is an excellent question." His eyes light up as he begins to speak.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Learning (the deep and powerful kind) involves: Dispositions (the ways students tend to act), Knowledge (the content) and the Skills (how to use knowledge). That's a good start but an important piece is still missing: What is in it for our students to learn (change)? What makes our topic relevant?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="34" id="mark-8e129171-a7e2-47df-88fc-38d8fa55f53f" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Relevance is the cornerstone of motivation. When things are relevant (to me) it means I will give of my time, my effort and my resources to do those things that I believe best meet my needs.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Relevance is always personal-like knowledge and learning. My reason to learn something is going to be different than yours. What Ramone is struggling with is a relevance issue-the big teaching and learning question: "Why do I have to know this?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>So, what matters to our students? Does the paper you just assigned matter? To whom? Why should it? If the only reason your students consider an assignment important is to avoid punishment, that's a problem. We frequently assign things that are important (only) to us and then wonder why students do not find them relevant (important enough to actually do).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Teachers are highly educated. We work in a field where most teachers believe that more education will increase students' quality of life (hopefully). What we do not know is what the future will hold for our students-what jobs will be available, how long those jobs and careers will be viable, and what society will actually value.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Those uncertainties mean we "predict" that what we teach today will in fact matter (be relevant) in the future. When students "trust" the teacher, that means they also trust the teacher's predictions about what will make them better (a big responsibility).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Students are living in a world where everything competes for their time-sports, friends, activities, social media, family. Teachers (and school assignments) are in competition with everything else students find interesting (and worth their time, effort and resources). In order for tasks to be considered "relevant" by our students they must be both of the following:</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>1. Real (falls within their timeframe of caring).</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>For many of our students the here and now is the "future." They might be willing to change a behavior for something going on this weekend (maybe) but things like "when you go to college," "get a job," and "get married," are too far in the future to impact their behavior today for the majority of our students.</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="2">True (has a high probability of actually taking place in the future) (Kolis, 2011).</li></ol></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="35" id="mark-01f702d0-f191-4b07-a4e0-a6eaca833f5b" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>When an experience is both Real and True, it is more likely that students will be motivated to learn (change). But change (learning) is hard. We do what we do because we think it works for us. Our thoughts and/or actions have become habits, and learning means to replace one pattern of thought and/or behavior with another - and that takes time, effort and resources to accomplish.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Since learning can be challenging, support helps (emotionally, intellectually, physically, socially and morally). The key learning idea is to provide the right kind of support at the right time. That means support that is: 1) not too much or too little, 2) not too soon or too late, and 3) not too easy or too hard. Support does not mean to do the task for them, give them the answer or remove the obstacles.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Support means to give them "just enough" help so they may continue their own learning journey. Trusting them enough to let them struggle through the challenging times shows them that you believe in them. It gives them the power to persevere. It also helps prepare them to be independent (later hopefully interdependent) human beings.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Relevance is all about "why" answers. Things that are seen as relevant allow people to commit themselves to the learning journey. If it matters to the individual, spending time, effort and resources becomes the means to the end, rather than an assignment to be completed.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Why" answers are also the basis for the "How" and "What" answers (the detail answers). "Why" answers make "purpose" explicit-and that matters because creating the habits of mind with an explicit purpose allows each individual to create their own personal visions and goals.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Note: We have been talking a lot about "end-in-mind" thinking. To clarify, this is not about "What do you want to be when you grow up?" rather "What kind of person do you wish to become?" It is the difference between "I want to be a CEO when I grow up" versus "I want to be a kind, caring, loving, responsible, trustworthy, independent (interdependent later), and respectful human being."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The key to making learning relevant is to provide opportunities to learn developmentally appropriate stuff that will cumulatively add up to the desired end-in-mind. Mickey's Story: My wife and I wanted our sons to grow up to be independent and proactive. That meant we had to allow them opportunities to grow into those characteristics.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="36" id="mark-7db4a565-4ce6-420e-99c6-8574b085a04e" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>When one of our sons was in second grade he got into trouble on the playground at school. His punishment was no more recess for the rest of the week. It was an appropriate punishment, but it really bothered him because he said he did not actually do the naughty behavior (and he loved recess).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>So we told him the correct procedure (call the principal and make an appointment) to discuss the situation. We never thought he actually would-but he did in fact call and make that appointment. I went with him for support, but told him I wouldn't speak because it was his deal.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>So we went and the principal was very kind. He asked what happened, how his friends would feel if he was not punished and what he might do differently the next time he was in that position. Our son addressed those issues and at the end a new solution was generated.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Recess and "fairness" were "relevant" to that son. He was willing to do the tasks required to address that need by himself with appropriate support. We did not "fix it" for him; we provided support that we hoped was developmentally appropriate.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>And that is the challenge for finding "relevance" for all our students. What is relevant to one may not be relevant to all. Working with students as individuals helps us make learning more relevant (if not totally) at that time and place.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Making learning both real and true helps. To make TQs relevant to our students, we must sell (be passionately committed to) the following ideas:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">The Explicit and Intentional use of Thinking Questions increases the chance (probability) of making a `"good"` decision (a good decision sounds like `"I made the best decision I could at that time in that place knowing what I knew"`).</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Helping our students create a powerful Habit of Mind (using TQs) will allow them to be "successful" in a rapidly changing world. Thinking-not a list of memorized facts-will be the coin of future success (personally as well as professionally).</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="37" id="mark-93d27fad-50bf-4a37-927a-c2cc0016f5da" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>In reality they already "think for themselves"; we just do not know what that thinking looks like or where it may be flawed. Since we do not teach "thinking" explicitly we also cannot be good teachers and coaches in that endeavor. We recognize it when we see it (they are a good "thinker") but we don't teach it intentionally.</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="2">Foster a `"take them from where they are and move them along the learning continuum"` perspective. We need to teach them where they are right now (meet their needs today, this minute) rather than prepare them for college, marriage, or the workforce (if we teach them in ways that meet their needs right now, they will be prepared for the future).</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>We live longer and longer and yet push our kids to graduate earlier and earlier. Life is not a race. Being potty trained first, graduating from high school early, skipping grades - these do not guarantee life success. Those are "parent competitions" with little regard for setting students up for life success, life lived toward a purpose and the development of strong relationships with others and the world.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>One beauty of a developmental perspective is that "learning activities" are always perfect (either they are doing it totally correct, or I now know what we need to learn next). In life outside of school most learning is in fact developmental - we rarely expect perfection. We expect to work toward perfection, always learning, always growing in our knowledge, our skills or our dispositions.</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="3">Our goal is to make ourselves dispensable. In terms of power that means we must keep what we must, share what we can and give what we dare. In life, we are not there when our students (or children) make their most important life decisions (sex, drinking, drugs, etc.), so we have to let them make their own decisions in developmentally appropriate situations (that means the consequences are age appropriate). Saving kids from consequences removes powerful learning opportunities.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>In the "old days" kids played a lot of "sandlot" games. They actually played games without adults being present! They picked their own teams, adjusted the fields and made their own calls. There were arguments but kids also then learned how to resolve them by themselves (or take the ball and go home).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Play is learning, and adults need to let go and let the kids learn things for themselves - not like the old days but better than the old days. Learning is a risky business, which is what makes it powerful and meaningful. "Nothing ventured, nothing gained." You accomplished something when the end was in doubt.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="38" id="mark-a7cd5d50-3549-434a-9ce9-17bd9ddb54cc" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br><ol><li value="4">Learning is a lifelong endeavor (learning defined as a `"change in thoughts, beliefs or actions"`). That means in the classroom the teacher needs to be the very best learner!</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Learning includes knowledge, skills and dispositions. Learning is an adaptability as well as a moving-forward mind-set. Current thoughts, beliefs and actions act as placeholders for future thoughts, beliefs and actions.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Learning matters in all parts of our lives (jobs, relationships, roles, etc.). People continue to change based upon their development and experiences.

What they have come to understand about the world through those experiences may be correct, inaccurate or totally wrong.

Educators already do that, right? Movies, memorization, group projects, and jeopardy review are all experiences, right? Sure they are. But are they powerful enough to help students Re-think, Re-view, and Re-conceptualize what they think they already know? Most of the time they aren't; they tend to fade into the background.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>We cannot provide more experiences than what they have already had to our students (they have a lifetime of those, and we get maybe five hours a week), so we have to make sure the experiences we can construct for them are powerful (more memorable, more learningful, of higher quality, more complex) in terms of thinking.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>So what makes one experience more powerful (more memorable, more learningful, of higher quality, more complex) than another one?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James nods at each one. "Yeah, yeah, all of those are correct of course. Each of those things is a part of who you are. Let me change the question a little bit: What can make you change your mind about something? What can change the way you think about something?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>There's a pause.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"OK, here's an example: You've always liked dogs. You didn't grow up with cats; you grew up with dogs. What might convince you that cats are equally good pets? Could anything convince you?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel says, "I grew up with cats.

Thinking Questions are based on real-life, hands-on experiences and what you think you already know (read the story Fish Is Fish by Leo Lionni). Consider driving to work versus riding to work. Same event, different perceptions. That difference gives us the space to notice things we've never noticed before, reflect, and change our perspectives.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James draws something on the board.</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_43.jpg?x=487&amp;y=811&amp;w=622&amp;h=542&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_43.jpg?x=487&amp;y=811&amp;w=622&amp;h=542&amp;r=0"><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>"I submit that your experiences are the foundation of what you know, believe and can do.

Very frequently we compare tastes (tastes like chicken) which are culturally biased, because we have not developed a large vocabulary for describing tastes generally.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Individual fields where taste is important have more specific terms like malty, hoppy, bitter, sweet, earthy, tinny.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking Question Gustatory Cue Words: Tastes like Flavors Spicy Sweet Salty Sour Bitter Savory</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Note: For Sense Thinking Questions the key is to have students describe what they observe (not the conclusions they draw from what they see). For example if you give them a pencil and ask them to make observations about what they see, they will frequently say "pencil" rather than make observations such as "it is five inches long, it is yellow, and it has five sides."</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="47" id="mark-ee4d47d8-831c-404c-9e6d-1260dec94db4" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Sometimes when asking students to make observations, using more open-ended Cue Words suffices. These allow students to access any Sense, which may be problematic and yet gives them choice.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking Question Generalized Cue Words: Observe Notice Detect Describe</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>We frequently do not have good language to describe our experiences (taste and smell are notoriously difficult). It appears so basic that we jump right to Conclusions rather than the Observations (think Sherlock Holmes). Jumping to conclusions is natural-knowing a pencil is a pencil is not wrong, just not the point of the exercise. The key for making Observations is to learn to notice the unnoticed.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>What we (each of us as individuals) observe is the foundation of how we think and what we know. Our life experiences lay the foundation for our thoughts, our beliefs and our actions. We want our students to develop the language and thinking skills to describe simple and familiar objects so that we can apply the same principles to more complex objects and situations which they might not already "know."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>As we get older we also have a tendency to notice what we want to notice and ignore other observations. Observations matter because they determine the quality of our experiences and how much information we will be able to recall in the future. The key aspect for teaching students how to make observations is to help them learn to use more of their senses on a regular basis. Information matters when it comes to thinking.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Classroom Examples:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Describe a strawberry using as many senses as possible.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">What do you notice about the uniform of a Civil War soldier?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">What did you observe about the people at the awards ceremony?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">What did you see when you looked at the `"couple"` at the mall?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="5">Describe what a well-constructed mask feels like.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Jack raises his hand and says, "I guess I see what you are saying; there's a difference between reading a Civil War story and eating CHAPTER 5 Civil War-era food at a reenactment.

When we leave and talk about the performance, sometime it's like we were at different events; even though we were there together watching and listening to the same performance, we understand it in very different ways.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Experiences are not just the information that gets into our brains from our senses. My wife and I processed the concert in different ways; we each used our unique set of Intelligences to process the experience."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Processing our observations means how we "think about" the information we took in (connections, relationships). We personalize the data we noticed (our senses) and since each person is an individual, we each emphasize some areas more than others. Processing observations includes the relationships we create with and between experiences and also how we connect those new experiences to our prior experiences.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>While we are genetically predisposed to process information in specific ways, we each have all of the intelligences, albeit with varying strengths and weaknesses. The more ways of processing information we access, the more robust the experience, and the easier the experience is to recall and the greater the quantity of information we can access later.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>So on the left we have our senses-the portals through which we receive information. On the right side we have the Multiple Intelligences (MI) (Gardner, 1983; Armstrong, 1993) by which we tend to process that information. One is not necessarily subordinate to the other-without senses we have no information, and without our Multiple Intelligences (processes), we have no way to relate the information to other information or prior experiences.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Processing Questions allow us to validate and access students' prior experiences, and to use each new experience as a foundation to reflect on other experiences, both new and old (How does this connect to what you've already experienced? What similar experiences have you had like this?).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Processing in groups is one powerful reason why working with others can be so helpful: Everyone adds their own specific way of processing to the experience. You processed the experience in your way, and so did I. Together we now each have access to more information than we would by ourselves.

The reality is that how we view any experience is even more complex than just those variables.

As such, it occupies the lofty peak on our diagram.

We take in information from our senses and our processing only after being filtered through our lenses. That means that not only do we focus on some information more than others (senses), connect them (or not) with prior experiences (processes), but they are also viewed (and sometimes distorted) by the lens we chose to use.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For example, think about watching a political debate with someone with different political affiliations. You are at the same place, watching the same debate, hearing the same words, and yet you both have very different views of what was said.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>These Mental Models are not "good" or "bad"; they just are. To live to our greatest potential requires us to be aware of the lenses we have. Peter Senge (1990) has said (one of my favorite quotes of all time), "[the] structures of which we are unaware hold us prisoner"; your mental model is one of these structures.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Our lenses in life ultimately reflect our deepest beliefs about the world, beliefs that are so deeply embedded in our lives they seem to be "common sense" (to us). They are the values we carry with us every day to every experience. It is how we perceive the world-what we value, what we care about, and how we think things work. Some common lenses involve:</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Money-how much is enough, its purpose, its worth, and its overall significance...</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Politics-Democratic, Republican, independent, what is the role of government, who has the power, what is the best use of power...</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Religion-pros and cons of any belief system, what does it look like when enacted, how does it change our daily behaviors...</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Family-what do different roles look like (daughter, son, husband, wife, father, mother, step-, etc. ), how important is it...</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Gender-what are the expectations for each gender, what about those who do not neatly fall into either category, how does it constrain/ advantage me...</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Race-what limits/advantages does it carry, what systems are in place, how others see me, what rules impact me...</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>And more (geography, birth order, socioeconomic status, language(s), etc.). This isn't an exhaustive list, just some of the more common ones.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="59" id="mark-450b869a-78b4-45e4-a819-ce1f3f4b9839" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Since our mental models are invisible to many of us, they act like a self-fulfilling prophecy-we see what we want to see and hear what we want to hear. If I think you are a horse's bottom end (my lens), everything you do will be viewed through that lens-unless I am aware of that lens and am willing to Re-consider that view. We need to be aware of the lenses we have so that we can choose to keep or change them when they don't meet our deepest or changing needs.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Changing our mental model is the most challenging kind of learning. Consider this: How often do people change their mind about politics, race, or religion? What are the things that you're not supposed to talk about at family gatherings?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Changing a mental model requires that you Re-consider your current experience, and all of the experiences leading up to your understanding as well. Only the most powerful experiences can change a person's lens in one fell swoop-near death experiences, having children, committing to a long-term relationship, loss of financial stability, and moving to very different place are all examples of this, and may lead people to Re-consider what really matters in their lives.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Barring giving our students near-death experiences (not recommended), we cannot make anyone "learn (change)" anything, especially their mental models. One positive approach to helping students address their mental models is through the lens of creativity and fun.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Intellectual "fun" means having the confidence and willingness to "play" with ideas. Play encourages us to experiment with different lenses without harm to ourselves or to our self-ego. It is play-imagining "how else" without being held accountable to actually do the change that matters.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>One key idea when thinking about mental models is to help people become aware of their beliefs (through their dispositions) so they can choose to keep them, modify them or change them a little at a time.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Classroom Examples:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">If you believed that there was only so much success in the world, then how might you view someone else winning an award?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Imagine being a strawberry farmer whose livelihood depends upon how many strawberries he/she sells.

We also must realize that some experiences are more powerful in terms of learning than others. Powerful experiences are not just about how many experiences you have had; they also include the notion of "How emotionally laden is the experience?" In our diagram, emotion is the foundation. I like to imagine that strongly emotional experiences have an intense color, and that less emotional experiences have less remarkable colors (deep red for a deeply angering experience, a pale red for mild irritation, transparent for neutral).</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_62.jpg?x=179&amp;y=745&amp;w=1148&amp;h=731&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_62.jpg?x=179&amp;y=745&amp;w=1148&amp;h=731&amp;r=0"><div><br></div><div><div><div>Diagram Explanation: The foundation for using experiences for learning rests upon the level of "emotion" of the experience. Things that are highly emotional (either good or bad) go right into our long-term memories.</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>Imagine a box of marbles mostly filled with clear marbles. The clear marbles represent the mundane experiences that you may or may not remember, like driving to work or opening a door. Now imagine that there are several intensely colored marbles among the clear ones: These vibrantly colored marbles represent highly emotional experiences, the more emotional the experience, the more intense the color of the marble. Compared to the mundane clear marbles, the vibrant marbles stand out, just like how out of all the days I attended class I can remember that one time I called my second grade teacher "Mom" with perfect clarity.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="61" id="mark-86cde054-5d94-47b4-950e-1415a2363bcb" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Experiences with unusually strong emotional content go right into long-term memory, no matter what lens, sensory detail, or processes are associated with it. Emotion is the gatekeeper to long-term memory (think of your most embarrassing moment-no matter how long ago chances are your face still gets red, you start to sweat... the physiological body response of that emotion goes right along with your experience for years afterwards).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Strong emotions are frequently connected to: success, failure, embarrassment, achievement, recognition, belittlement, pride, getting caught doing something "wrong," errors, meeting goals, novelty, unexpectedness, surprise, cognitive dissonance (ideas that defy what people think they know), a-ha moments, and punishment, and can be either personal or social in nature.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>In terms of positive, emotionally charged learning, success is the greatest motivator. Success on any task is the result of four components: 1) the task itself; 2) personal ability/aptitude for that task; 3) time, effort and resources allocated by the individual to the task; and 4) luck (time, day, teacher, classmates, etc.). The one component that students control is number three-time, effort and resources they commit to the learning task.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>One reason we need to celebrate more (a strong emotion) is that recognizing learning success allows students to put that positive experience into long-term memory. Having experienced success before gives students "hope" that they can be successful again. The teacher can then use that prior experience to help students overcome doubt when success is questionable.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Making the standard for success so low that everyone is successful (participation awards) takes away the emotional benefit of "success." Success must be the result of achieving learning (change), not participation. The person him- or herself must see the task as emotionally weighted (not the giver).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>One last note about using Emotion as a learning tool. Things that students see as "relevant" have the emotional component built in to the experience!

Car, book, poem, racket, dinner, phone and all the rest of the words we use are the representation of our many experiences with that thing. Our definitions of the words we use are always our personal definitions based upon our experiences.</li></ul><br></div><div><div><div>The brain is an organ, and organs are defined as different tissues that work together to complete a particular function. The brain's function is to seek patterns. When we recognize a pattern we give that pattern a name and/ or label such as dog, book, apple, friend, mom. Basically all the words we use are representations of our experiences that our brains have tied together.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>And since our perceptions are unique to us, everything we think we know is contextual (based upon our personal experiences). The interesting thing is that we find those patterns while living in a very messy world in terms of experiences (they are not sequential, nor linear-experiences happen when they happen).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Our brains are able to connect those experiences together and make "sense" of them. This "making sense"-finding the commonalities (the sticks our experiences have in common) among varied experiences-is called Inductive Reasoning. It is how we learn outside of classrooms. This is also why personal words and working definitions are so unique-they are based upon personal experiences (my conceptual understanding of the term mom is based upon my experiences with all the moms I have ever known, heavily weighted toward my own mom).</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="66" id="mark-a8a271ed-fa40-44b8-a18c-1ce66e4d1de1" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>The making of generalizations (this word means this) looks like the following:</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_68.jpg?x=180&amp;y=430&amp;w=1147&amp;h=612&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_68.jpg?x=180&amp;y=430&amp;w=1147&amp;h=612&amp;r=0"><div><br></div><div><div><div>Diagram Explanation: For every experience (triangle) we have, we view that experience with our senses (sticks on the left), we process it in certain ways (sticks on the right), we view it through our mental models (lens) and we assign some emotional quotient to it (sticks on the bottom). When we have another (or more) experience with the same category of thing, we break apart our prior experience and look for "sticks" that are similar and different from each other—this is called Induction.

Generalizations mean knowing what is in the middle and that it is also appropriate (and still normal) to have examples at either end of the spectrum.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Individuals need enough (varied) experiences to know what is "normal" and accepted and what is unusual.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>On the whole, generalizations allow us to talk about the bell-shaped curve of experiences (normal, unique, isolated, singular, common, etc.). There is always some variation in any kind of experience (fishing, listening to music, cooking/eating a meal, etc.) and it is important to know where that one specific experience falls among all the experiences.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Note: Generalizations are not stereotypes. Stereotypes are frequently stated as "All (of any thing) exhibit these characteristics or act the same." Stereotypes attempt to define any one idea as the same thing. Generalizations include the idea of variation with some commonalities.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The question becomes what is "normal variation" and what is so unusual as to be noticed. Learners need multiple, varied experiences to have a more complex understanding of what the experiences were all about.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Imagine for a moment that you live on a ranch in an isolated part of Montana (not hard to imagine if you've ever visited Montana).

So the first time you see a wiener dog, you might not even think "dog"-you are unsure of what that animal is, because to you (based upon your life experiences), dogs are black, weigh about 70 pounds, and act in goofy, lovable ways.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="68" id="mark-74529591-3ad7-483b-8f6a-bb74119915c2" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Multiple, diverse experiences with the same concept make thinking and working definitions more robust (and frustrating to define); yet deep understanding means to know what the norm is (what is a normal variation) and what is an outlier.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>That means if I really wanted someone to create a robust definition of the concept "dog" (inductively) I would have to have them experience big dogs, little dogs, dogs with shaggy fur and dogs with almost none.

This back and forth iteration is heightened when we add a new experience or new perspective to the mix.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="72" id="mark-f28b21fc-fb3e-47d4-86f1-5a4804b7dfdc" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>We are all prisoners of our past experiences. We always come back to what we have experienced, what we think we "know" from our personal experiences-with our mental models in place and with our emotional baggage; we are not blank slates. And while the thinking diagrams attempt to make thinking look concrete and sequential, it just isn't that simple. Thinking is circular.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>When we have an experience (either a new one or another of the same) we may Re-think what we know based upon the interplay between new and old experiences. In the face of new experiences we can:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Ignore the new experience,</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Modify our current thoughts, beliefs or actions, or</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Struggle to put a new belief system, knowledge or skills into place.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Which of those three options any person chooses has everything to do with the learning environment, the self-esteem of the learner, and his or her willingness to take learning risks.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Circular Thinking means that students will continually come back to the concrete experiences you provide in relationship to what they think they already know from their prior experiences (the triangles).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Here is an example of Circular Thinking for the concept of "dog." Imagine the life of a three-year-old. They do not have a "dog" of their own, but they have random experiences with dogs during the course of their everyday activities.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Even as a three-year-old, they have multiple experiences with "dogs." They see dogs in the streets, they get to pet them in the park, and one of their friends has one which they get to pet, smell, and play with. And the dogs they "see" are not the same: Some are big, some small, some yellow, some black. Yet their parents call them all the same: "doggy."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Sometimes as they are learning the concept "dog" they make mistakes-a cat is a dog, a squirrel is a dog, a raccoon is a dog, and a Chihuahua is a dog (oh wait a minute, it is a dog!). Almost anything that has fur, four legs, ears and a tail gets the same label.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For every experience they have with a "dog" (right or wrong) they have to put that experience with all their other experiences with that concept. And let's be very clear, it's a very fine line between dogs and cats (and squirrels and raccoons).</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="73" id="mark-20ebb1f8-8504-4171-a420-95c8bb754870" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking is a constant iteration of "what you think you know" in light of the new experience. That type of thinking takes place outside the school and in those real-life settings is considered "normal."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Sometimes the "new information" that a teacher provides is in the form of facts. Experiences are not necessarily facts. Facts are the summary or synthesis of multiple experiences. Facts are the "distillation" of multiple experiences. Many times facts are right (but they can be wrong too). Facts may also be: reliable, accurate, unbiased (or at least the bias is known) and many times measurable (or the result of those measurements).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Facts may also be statements by experts from the field. In those cases we give credence to the statement because the acknowledged expert has said something is so. Interestingly, even when facts are presented, they also fall along a bell-shaped curve of "accepted" or "normal" belief.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>In all cases (either a new experience or the introduction of new facts) the learner has to compare those new thoughts to the experiences they themselves have had. They get to Re-think what they think they know in light of that new information. Thinking is hard work.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For teachers, it would be more structured to provide students with lots of different dogs and ask the following questions:</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Sensory questions: What does each dog: Look like (visual)? Smell like (olfactory-both dry and wet)? Feel like (tactile)? How does it move (kinesthetic)? What do they sound like (auditory)? It may not be appropriate to ask them to Taste the dogs (although that does occasionally happen).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Processing questions (connect to what they already know): How and why do dogs interact with people (Interpersonal)? Why does petting a dog when you are sad make you feel better (Intrapersonal)? What role do dogs play in nature (Naturalist)? How are the barks of dogs like that of something else, like a coyote or wolf (Musical)? What stories might you have about a dog (Verbal-Linguistic)? Do dogs go to heaven (Existentialist)? What are dogs worth (Logical-Mathematical)? What pictures of dogs might you have seen or made, and are they correct or incorrect (Spatial)?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="74" id="mark-58ee7e27-cf1d-4b05-8053-4def2d493393" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>C H A P T E R 9</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The more Sense and Process questions you ask, the more robust the experience (and the easier it is for them to Re-call that experience and the associated details).</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>CIRCULAR THINKING AND THE RE-CONCEPT</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>The Re-Concept emerged from many different words: Re-think, Re-view, Re-conceptualize, Re-call, Re-imagine, and Re-consider. It means to think once more about what you think you know in light of something new, some new experience, new perspective or new thought.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The Re-Concept acknowledges the fact that you already have something in your head (a conceptual understanding), and you are going to think about it again in light of something new (information, insight, experience, etc.). This is the essence of thinking.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The Re-Concept also means your current dispositions, thoughts and skills are placeholders for new personal growth. And that works if your definition of learning encompasses a change in thoughts, beliefs or actions.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For our students, by the time they are in schools, they already have thoughts, beliefs and actions in place (they are not blank slates for us to write upon). It also does not work to tell them their disposition, knowledge, or skill is wrong because what they are doing already appears to meet their needs (and match their experiences).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>We have to entice, not force them to Re-think (habits of mind) what they already think they know-to better meet their needs. Providing a new and different experience (concrete is best) pushes them to think beyond their current experiences.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Re-thinking, re-imagining requires a "willingness" to consider something new (a disposition) and go back to what you think you know. If you have planned their experiences in powerful ways (lots of senses, processes and emotion), they can always access those experiences and Re-think them.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Powerful learning requires a safe environment to "wonder" and consider new experiences and new definitions/alternatives. Learners need enough facts and perspectives, an environment that reduces risk, and enough time to Re-consider how else to meet their needs. And even under ideal circumstances, learning-especially at the belief level-takes effort, resources, and time. Change is challenging.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="75" id="mark-f5f900e9-264b-41c4-b186-b3559e96a94c" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>We are each constrained and defined by our personal experiences.

I would never have guessed that something so powerful had happened there."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Sarah responds, "Last year I acted in To Kill a Mockingbird.

John Dewey (1934) has said we do not learn from experiences; we learn from processing those experiences. Again, our definition of learning is a change in thoughts, beliefs, or actions. That means we frequently have the same experience over and over P A R T I I again, because nothing changes (which means we have not learned from those experiences).</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="77" id="mark-10f2cecb-ace4-42b5-965d-90089ea5f1f6" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Using our experiences (and those the teacher constructs for us) as our basis for "thinking" allows us to personalize our knowledge.

Teachers frequently ask students to List things, Classify things, or write the Steps of things. Unfortunately, most of the time those ideas have already been lectured on and the task becomes a re-call/memorization task rather than a Thinking task. Analysis means going from the whole, the concept itself, to the parts that make it up-by yourself.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="79" id="mark-247e7ace-e7d0-4359-81ce-4117b9893867" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br><!-- Media --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_82.jpg?x=179&amp;y=277&amp;w=1154&amp;h=674&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_82.jpg?x=179&amp;y=277&amp;w=1154&amp;h=674&amp;r=0"><div><br></div><div><div><div>Diagram Explanation: Our conceptual understandings (the circle) emerge from our experiences (the triangles), and more importantly how we think about those experiences. When our understanding is robust, we can then think about those pie pieces that are common among ALL the experiences (not just one or a few). In the diagram there is nothing magical about four pie pieces other than they represent however many pieces of the whole the learner can identify.</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking Question Analysis Cue Words: List Parts Steps Classify Sequence Mind map Pieces Components Elements Common elements Commonalities Common characteristics</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>A robust analysis is based upon multiple experiences with a concept, not describing a single experience (that would be observation-senses, processes, mental models and emotions). That is why a diverse set of experiences creates a more thoughtful analysis that addresses the norms of the concept being studied.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Analysis in this context is more challenging than we might think. For example, consider the following question: "What precursors led to the Civil A N A L Y S I S War?" Many think that it is an analysis question. Since it only asks about one experience (the Civil War), in reality that question is an Observation-Process question. An analysis question would be: "What common characteristics are there between the precursors to all wars?" (or at least the Civil War and one or two other wars).</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="80" id="mark-52a62dfc-9b5a-4adc-b6aa-5c6b8559769c" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Analysis is really the process of making explicit "which sticks (senses and processes) are shared among the many experiences." Do they all look the same? Feel the same? Share the same pattern? Exhibit similar causes and effects? Analysis says that for this concept, all (or at least generally speaking) the examples share these same features.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For example, if the concept under study was "bicycles" and we had studied (experienced) road bikes, mountain bikes, cruiser bikes and racing bikes, we could say (analysis) bicycles have: two wheels, handlebars, pedals (two), chains, and so on. If we had studied different types of bicycles than the ones we did (different experiences), our analysis might be different.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>To teach analysis thinking successfully requires that the teacher know those 3-D experiences very well, and constantly reference those experiences when analysis items are incorrect (What about our experience with X?-rather than "Wrong.") This continuous connecting of thinking to prior experiences and prior types of thinking is the "art of teaching thinking."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For powerful learning to take place the learner must come up with the pieces by themselves. The teacher's role is to make sure their pieces match all the experiences that have been provided. Student answers are then not right or wrong; instead they become the basis for asking "What about (a certain specified experience they have had that adds more information)?"- thus requiring students to "think" for themselves, to Re-consider their own answers with more information, and to account for all their prior thinking and experiences.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Multiple, powerful (in terms of remembering) experiences are key to a good analysis. The teacher's role becomes one of leading students to "discover" the pieces for themselves, based upon the concrete experiences that have been provided. One cannot "assume" students have had specific prior experiences because some will not have had those experiences, and that impacts their ability to find those important pieces.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="81" id="mark-50627e96-ea2f-47b3-88bd-da1bb4e18372" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>With circular thinking the sticks of experience (senses and processes)</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_84.jpg?x=179&amp;y=384&amp;w=1147&amp;h=520&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_84.jpg?x=179&amp;y=384&amp;w=1147&amp;h=520&amp;r=0"><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>become more and more helpful to good analysis because they provide concrete data for students to consider.

When that happens (and it will) the teacher's fallback position is to go back and add more concrete experiences so that the pieces misidentified become more obvious.

Maybe you focused on a sub-concept (terriers) rather than the concept you intended (dogs). By limiting the experiences you narrow the analysis.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Another common error (perhaps the most common) is having students memorize the parts of a concept and thinking they are "doing" analysis. It might sound like: "List the parts of the cell," or "List the 50 state capitals." For analysis to be "thinking" on the part of the students they must come up with the pieces on their own (continuously referencing their concrete experiences).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Forcing students to memorize lists limits the sorts of experiences they can bring to bear on a question. There are multiple correct answers for an analysis question, and students will give different answers depending on who they are.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>There is a Cost for having students think for themselves: You will cover less material (and it is difficult to provide and think of concrete experiences for all concepts). The Benefit is they remember experiences (and can access them), they figure stuff out for themselves and they grow the ability and confidence to think for themselves. Thinking allows students to create new habits of mind, and by empowering our students we make ourselves dispensable. That just takes more time.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Analysis also matters as a foundational piece of future thinking as well. One characteristic of creativity is "putting pieces together that have not been combined before." That means that being aware of the pieces (analysis) from multiple concepts provides opportunities to be creative.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The pieces matter when it comes to thinking. The process of Analysis Thinking is both the forest (the concept-the circle) and the trees (the pie pieces) (and the shrubs and the animals and the soil, etc.). Thoughtful analysis is really iterative; it is about the relationships between the pieces and whole. The concept itself is more than just the pieces; it is the pieces and how those pieces are related.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Classroom Examples: (Thinking task for the reader-What experiences would have been provided so that students could answer the following analysis questions?

They didn't have machine guns or airplanes or really effective artillery until early 1900s I think. Technology made it possible to kill multiple hundreds, or even multiple thousands of people in just one battle, which would have been unthinkable during the Civil War. That's a pretty big change."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>This process of analyzing two closely related ideas is called "same/different."

The key point of same/different is to create a better, more thoughtful, and more accurate Analysis. It allows the learner to add more pieces to each analysis list, which allows for a more detailed picture of the whole (the concept in question).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Analysis matters because those are the pieces that are shared by all the examples of that concept. The lists are specific to the concept, and only that concept.

Since we all have our own "working" definitions for almost any term, clarity requires that we both have the same conceptual understanding of the term we are both using. Your idea of "good" may be totally different than mine, and yet when we talk and say the word good, we both nod, thinking we understand that other person.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="86" id="mark-e34f965a-bcb8-4306-97e2-f7ec4250c029" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>All analysis thinking requires the learner to "Circular think," first going back to the experiences themselves, then the concept itself, and then the pieces of the concept.

In other words, as you try to find similarities and differences between two very different ideas, sometimes you come across similarities that you have not noticed before. Your "analysis" of each is enhanced by comparison of the two (pieces that are invisible are not explicit).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Um," says Jack. "Maybe.

And in the big scheme of things, the classification of the question is less important than the thinking process itself.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Frequently Insight has an emotional response, called "gestalt" or the a-ha! moment. When the person sees the connections or the pieces finally fall into place, they literally "feel" the answer! One other nonverbal sign of an insight question is when asked for the comparison, the person answering the question gives a big eye blink or at least a big furrow appears between their eyes. Those are some ways you know they are thinking!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="89" id="mark-b7f9211b-1b56-4a8b-9093-16665e7335d2" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>For many public school students (who have not been asked to "think" much before), they need to be pushed into comparing dissimilar things. After a short while, they will start making those connections themselves (especially to what they know well-fishing, games, music, etc.). They will say things like "This is a lot like skateboarding ..." or "This reminds me of World of Warcraft ..."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Again, the thinking for Insight is comparing things not closely related, even though the thinking process is the same as Same/Different. The idea is to look for deep patterns and previously unnoticed connections between things not normally compared.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Insight is a very high-order thinking skill. It requires the ability to connect things (deep patterns) with things not normally compared. It truly demonstrates a "depth of understanding" between multiple concepts.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>To teach insight well, you have to teach the diagram-making the thinking both Explicit and Intentional. First provide experiences that support one concept and then experiences that support the other concept, and then compare.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Circular thinking: You may have to find out what they think they already know well (games, hobbies, crafts, learning process itself, etc.) - and then compare those things to the concept you are teaching.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Insight matters because recognizing connections (similarities and differences) simplifies our lives. Things that we previously thought were isolated become connected. The deep patterns become evident or the pieces of the concept suddenly become related when compared to some other concept.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>In terms of classroom thinking, insight is a teacher's best friend. Again, insight is the analysis process of comparing two very different concepts (for the learner). That means comparing content to something the student knows well allows them to connect what appears (to them) to be very different concepts. This allows students to use what they already know to better understand a content concept - and maybe help make content more relevant.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For example, comparing the beginnings of a war to arguments with a friend, or rap lyrics to classical poetry, or trying a new trick to experimentation, or learning a new soccer move to movement concepts. At the deepest level, the central concepts we try to teach are always connected to everyday learning-just with different content.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="90" id="mark-6c464c26-acc3-4a11-846b-aab1020a8879" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>I N S I G H T</div></div></h2><div><br></div><h2><div><div>Classroom Examples:</div></div></h2><div><br><ol><li value="1">What connections are there between fruits and computers?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">What common pattern exists between the ideas of plot and our interviews with people who have been recognized for their successes?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Identify the interrelationships between state rights and scoring at the X Games.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Sarah and Jack are still chatting when Jack asks, "So what do you think was the number one reason for WWI?" ⓭</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="91" id="mark-ceccd693-f8f7-4d76-9097-75f5ba62d2b7" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>APPRAISAL</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James and Rachel are talking about the importance of grades. During their dialogue they talk about grades and what they might mean. They consider: measure of achievement, checkpoint for fact acquisition, work ethic, knowledge or skill evaluation. After a pause, Mr. James asks, "Those are all good reasons to grade; which one do you think is the most important?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Appraisal is the intellectual act of assigning value to the pieces of the concept. It forces the person to make choices, identify the hierarchy, or rank the pieces in terms of importance. Not all pieces of almost anything are of equal value.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Wiggins and McTighe (1998) appraise (rank) content information in terms of "enduring, important, and familiar with" rankings. They posit that some ideas in any content area are enduring-they are the "big ideas" of the field, and other information is important - and thus worth knowing. Other ideas are not so critical to know-but might be nice to know depending on the situation.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Appraisal matters because we can't have or do everything we want. We have to pick and choose. It is the picking and choosing that makes the task complex, because our past experiences and our knowledge (at that time and place) have a dramatic impact upon how we rank order any list.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="92" id="mark-c42a785c-4570-493c-9450-8ee6f44261b3" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br><!-- Media --><br></div><img src="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_95.jpg?x=226&amp;y=285&amp;w=1146&amp;h=409&amp;r=0" alt="https://cdn.noedgeai.com/019481d8-b9e7-757e-bdb8-c13e726ba2f6_95.jpg?x=226&amp;y=285&amp;w=1146&amp;h=409&amp;r=0"><div><br></div><div><div><div>Diagram Explanation: After identifying the pieces (analysis), the learner then revisits their experiences and gives value to each of the pieces (different size pie pieces). Some things are always more important than other things (bigger pie pieces), and sometimes they really do not matter that much (the smaller pie pieces). Appraisal makes those rankings explicit, which then tells everyone else how they have experienced that concept.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking Question Appraisal Cue Words: Weigh Rank Rate Grade Prioritize Most to least Value Least to most One a scale of ...</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>Appraisal thinking is grounded in personal experiences (the triangles again). In terms of giving value to the items, criteria are mostly personal (versus professional) in nature. That means I will rank the items based upon my personal experiences-these things are most or least important to me based upon my prior experiences.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The thinking aspect of appraisal is not so much the right or wrong order of the ranking; the real thinking task is making explicit the "rationale" for ranking the items the way you did. The rationale connects directly to the prior experiences students have had with the concept, shows their knowledge (or lack thereof) about the concept and also makes explicit what the individual values. That is powerful information in just one thinking skill - and why it's a four-step thinking task.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="93" id="mark-8e717370-e507-4189-82c8-b26842428d42" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel responds: "I think the most important reason for teachers to give grades is to help students get into the college of their choice, and then maybe to help rank students so that the smartest ones get some scholarships. It's a way for society to put money where it can be used wisely."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Another interesting aspect of Appraisal is that the rankings change with the context or a change in purpose. Ultimately, if you change the context or the purpose you change the rankings. And sometimes if you add more information you change the rankings as well.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Consider camping. Camping is a very contextual activity. There's car camping, beach camping, wilderness camping, boat camping, and more. In most cases of camping, space is a limiting factor-so the individual must prioritize the items they wish to take.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Car camping: Yes, take that music system! Wilderness camping: Better pack that water filter. Where (and how long) the camping trip is supposed to go totally changes the rankings of things to take-context matters. It reminds me of that saying: "You can have anything you want, but you can't have everything you want."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>We are constantly appraising things: what to do, what to buy, where to give our time, effort and resources over a multitude of other choices-because our resources (or time or effort) are limited. Choice theory (Glasser, 1998) talks about how we control our actions to best meet our needs (versus whim, serendipity, luck, fate, etc.). The more thoughtful the experiences we have, the better (in meeting our needs) our rankings will be.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Another name for "thoughtful experience" could be called Reflection. It is the idea of Re-considering what happened, why it might have happened, and how to Re-create or avoid the same result the next time. In this light, reflection has a large "appraisal" component to it (this part went well, change this part the next time).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Sometimes as a novice, one emotionally laden experience will bias our entire conceptual understanding over all other experiences (no bell-shaped curve of understanding). The one experience was a total win (fantastic!), or alternatively a total loss (horrible). In either case that one experience overshadows other more "normal" experiences. The one experience becomes A P P R A I S A L the conceptual understanding in spite of overwhelming evidence (other, multiple experiences) to the contrary.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="94" id="mark-2e7015bc-74ff-435d-bf32-6a53b5b1bf2f" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>When students are asked to provide their rationale for their rankings they provide the teacher (and the other students) with their personal experiences and knowledge of the concept at hand. They share what they have done, how they think about that experience and what they consider to be important and valuable. This is powerful information for any teacher who teaches people (rather than content).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Personal experiences are not "good" nor "bad" - they just are. This is especially true when you include the idea of Mental Models and how they influence a person's experiences. All the teacher can do to help individuals Re-prioritize is: 1) add more experiences (and more senses and processes), 2) have others share their experiences (build a stronger bell-shaped curve), and 3) show other ways of ranking with other rationale (in a safe learning environment).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Classroom Examples:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Prioritize the list of things you have to accomplish today.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Rank order the top three most important characteristics of a friend.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Rank the most important aspects that compose high-quality literature.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">List your top five favorite foods from most to least favorite.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="5">List your top five reasons for the causes of interpersonal conflict.

One example might be the Bible verse John 3:16; for many individuals it is the entire Christian religion in one sentence.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Many times summaries also include the "emotion-laden" part of the experience-how the summarizer connects emotionally with the concept being summarized. The "summarizer" condenses their experiences, their own mental models and their emotion-laden experiences and uses analysis and appraisal skills to reduce the concept to what they believe to be most important.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Summaries are not the same as the number one most important item. They "summarize" the entire concept into a few words or a phrase (dog: man's best friend). They are that person's essence of the concept-not just the one part that is most important (appraisal). It is the result of analysis and appraisal in terms of thinking skills, and yet summaries are more complex than either.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>That means that a person's summary tells everyone else how they really think about the concept at hand: their experiences, the emotions involved, the parts of that experience (analysis) and how those pieces are ranked (appraisal).

But that summary only applies to individuals who have multiple positive experiences with dogs.

"Man's best friend" tells everyone not just about dogs but also about that person's experiences with dogs over time.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Ramone raises his hand partway through class and says: "Football is the human experience."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>As a Thinking Question, teaching summary means knowing the differences between a Poor and a Good summary.

However, that one person's opinion is not the same as an expert's evaluation (not even close). A more holistic graphic might be to imagine a continuum with Opinion at one end and Evaluation at the opposite. Consider global warming: Does the opinion of some politician hold the same weight as an environmental scientist?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>To "evaluate" is to determine the value of or judge the quality of something. Evaluations determine the significance or worth of the thing in question by careful appraisal and study, and include making criteria in use explicit. Evaluation is a question of Quality (think Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Great teachers are constantly evaluating the teaching and learning that takes place in their classrooms. Great teachers collect and use student learning data to help them judge the quality of learning taking place (versus only opinion as in "I think it went well"). As a teaching expert, they know the skills and strategies that determine high-quality instruction and where others might give a lesson a ten, they might give the exact same lesson a seven. The best teachers are also the most realistic about which lessons worked and which did not.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="101" id="mark-130012b5-65e6-45e7-aa34-49ae06678a4c" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Criteria may also be called "deciders": the things you consider when making choices. For example, when I am at the grocery store I might consider the upcoming menu to help me "decide" what to purchase, how many people will be home might help me decide quantity, and also what is on sale (money is almost always a criteria for purchases).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking becomes more complex when an individual has to judge the quality of a thing. We might have many experiences with that thing or idea, but have never thoughtfully considered what makes something "better" (of higher quality) than something else. So I might have an opinion (based upon my experiences) - but not an evaluation (based upon the "expert-level" criteria). An expert in the field knows the accepted criteria; a novice does not.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mickey's Story: I have lived in houses for most of my life. Yet shopping and buying a new house is a nerve-wracking experience.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>A few years ago my wife and I were looking for a new (to us) house on the river near our home-we've always wanted to live on the water. We found one that interested us and were about to start shopping for loans. As part of that process we also contacted a realtor friend about selling our current house. He mentioned that he would be happy to "walk through" the house we were considering buying. So we took him up on his offer.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>It was like walking through an entirely different house. Since he was an “expert” he considered things we weren’t even aware of: floodplain insurance, age of the septic system, building codes on the water, the age of the electrical wiring-the list was quite extensive.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>He provided us with his evaluation as an expert-we on the other hand were looking at the house with our opinions in play.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>In reality, as far as Thinking Questions go, Evaluation is really a two-part process:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Determining the expert criteria for the situation at hand, and</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Applying those criteria to determine the quality of the thing in question.</li></ol></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="102" id="mark-2ecfe4c9-b285-4de7-aa10-7226b0b980a9" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>A tricky part of "expertness" is that the criteria are very, very context specific. The process of using criteria can be generalized; the criteria themselves are context specific. That means that the criteria for determining the quality of, say, a flute, are very different than the criteria for determining the quality of, say, a bicycle. The process for finding the expert criteria are similar-find an expert and ask them!</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>All this matters because the focus on thinking Evaluation for students is for them to determine the expert criteria in use, in an inductive way. That means they need to look for, search and determine the criteria themselves, and then apply them. This thinking process includes concrete experiences, inductive thinking, analysis, appraisal, and summary thinking.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Classroom Examples:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Using what we have learned about powerful stories, identify your criteria and use them to critique this story.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Evaluate the farmer's use of pesticides.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Evaluate the musician's performance of this rhythm.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">How might an actual scientist evaluate these results?</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>When we ask students to "think," we need to be aware of all the types of thinking that are required to answer that question. Concept? They need experiences. Analysis? They need conceptual understanding. Evaluation? They need all the other steps listed so far. And more importantly, they need to know Explicitly, how they have already thought.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>"Explicit" and "Intentional" are crucial aspects to consider when teaching the art of thinking.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="103" id="mark-28c961f0-c62d-4414-b575-fd2bfc0ab305" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>⓱</div></div></h2><div><br></div><h2><div><div>FUTURE THINKING QUESTIONS</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James walks into class today with a tennis ball, a Nerf basket that he hangs on the door, and a pirate hat. He looks at the class and gives the following prompt: "Using these three items, create a mini-play about the meeting of General Lee and President Lincoln. You have 30 minutes and it must include at least ten historically accurate facts. Think about this as a warm-up and practice round for our Meeting of the Minds project in the coming weeks. Feel free to be experimental, be silly, be whatever you want-except boring. You may begin."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Concrete, three-dimensional experiences are the foundation for our personal learning (at least until we are in our early 20s). More than that, how we think about those experiences (analysis, appraisal, summary, and evaluation) determines what we "learn" from any experience.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Sometimes we have experiences but don't think about them in powerful (thinking) ways or those experiences are not valued as important and powerful; therefore learning opportunities are missed or ignored. Those missed or ignored opportunities limit what we know, how we think, how we view reality—and what we ultimately can DO with those experiences.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="104" id="mark-e85080d3-8c53-408e-9c2a-61937e244b5d" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>A quick Re-view before we move on. For students to "think" for themselves:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Start with multiple, concrete (3-D) experiences of the same concept. Include senses and processes, address mental models and emotional variables.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Define the concept that matches the experiences you provided. Remember the bell-shaped curve of experiences (`"normal"` versus exceptional).</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Analyze the concept (not just one experience). Identify the pieces, and then compare them to closely related (Same/Different) and very different (Insight) concepts.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">Appraise the pieces - give them value - using both prior experiences and set criteria.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="5">Summarize the concept (key point, find the essence).</li></ol><br><ol><li value="6">Evaluate-determine the criteria by which quality will be determined. Think like an expert!</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Part IV deals with getting ready and DOing something with our learning-it is an Action-Orientation. It extends our thinking from what is to what might be.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>We demonstrate our learning through our actions! That means we personalize the content, work through the thinking processes and then demonstrate our personal learning to others.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The last three steps are really the culmination of "thinking"-the end-in-mind we seek. If we Intentionally and Explicitly ask students to "think" for themselves, then we might hope to: 1) create self-actualized participants in a democratic society; 2) have students know themselves (strengths and weaknesses); 3) create an action-oriented habit of mind; 4) learn to work with the resources you have (not the ones you wish you had); 5) have students own their own learning (consciously and explicitly); and 6) make decisions like an expert.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Those end-in-minds require that we give students choices, power, and opportunities to fail (and succeed greatly). The answers they must seek are not the ones in textbooks-they are the answers that matter to them, today, right at this moment in time.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="105" id="mark-eef3150e-3122-4ca6-a155-b9dd82c2365c" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>The next set of future Thinking Questions begins in chapter 16, a creativity focus.

The conversations with Mr. James throughout the semester have helped to get them on board with the way he does things, so much so that they're beginning to get frustrated with their other classes and ask obnoxious questions of their other teachers like "Why do we have to know this?" and "What does X have in common with Y?"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James reins them in for a moment and gives them today's task: "Today I need you to begin thinking about your Meeting-of-the-Mind Role Plays (see appendix B) you will be doing next week.

One reason for that problem is that the word creativity is used interchangeably with other great words such as imagination, ingenuity, innovation, intuition, invention, discovery, and originality-all wonderful ideas for our students to strive toward.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="107" id="mark-a49bd539-af5c-4c24-a8d4-1669f9d89f87" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>A Thinking Question focus on thinking creatively drives us toward identifying the facets that make up "Creative" thinking and include:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Combining pieces that have not been combined before,</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Imagining and presenting things from new perspectives,</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Focusing on new ways, new options, new modifications, and new connections to other concepts, and</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">Deferring judgment!!

The diagram represents thinking of multiple concepts (not just the two shown), thinking of those pieces, thinking about the best pieces and then putting ideas from those concepts together in novel or unique or new ways. The more diverse the conceptual understandings, the more likely it is to create a new idea.</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>We need to generate lots (and lots) of ideas if we are to find the truly unique, novel, workable ideas that have a creative bent. Research in creativity points to the idea that only two or three ideas out of 100 fit that definition, and those ideas almost always occur toward the end of the list.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>That means we need to think about our experiences, think about what we think we know about the concept, find the pieces, appraise those pieces, figure out what is the essence of the concept, re-consider our experiences in light of criteria to evaluate the concept-and then (doing that with many of our experiences) put pieces together in ways that have not been combined before!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="108" id="mark-21f47e49-4f90-4688-beb5-5c2113bbbd26" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><h2><div><div>Creativity Thinking Question Cue Words:</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Ideas Options Ways Changes Changes Opportunities Possibilities How else ... Improvements New</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>List-followed by a number (75) may also be a creative cue word-if the task is to generate new ideas rather than list what is already known.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Creativity as a Thinking Question focuses on the creation of a Content-Specific Task. It is the extension of the concept you were trying to get them to understand (Induction) and how your field (science, language arts, math, etc.) goes about creating something new, showing something from a new perspective, or finding a new take on an old idea.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Content-Specific Tasks: Build Compose Act Draw Role Play Experiment Script Design Tell</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Some examples: in science-a new experiment; in language arts-an original poem or short story; in history-a new biography; in PE-a new game; in music-a new composition or arrangement. Creativity says to students, "Create something new using the ideas we have already learned."</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Creativity as Thinking Question is relevant to students because it allows them to put "their take" on the concept at hand, and to have valued the connections they see (and many others may not). Creativity extends their prior knowledge (the other Thinking Questions) into the future and creates a new and different reality.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Creativity is also Fun ("fun" being defined as "appropriately challenging"). Since there are many ways to be "right," pressures come not from being right or wrong but from making connections and being in fact "creative." The "right answer" is not the focal point; how you are perceiving the concept in new and different ways is.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="109" id="mark-cc09c050-8133-49a6-ad4a-7f2cccd35845" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>While not textbook driven, creativity as Thinking Question is still very content heavy. To combine pieces not combined before means you must first know the pieces themselves. To put old ideas into a new context means you still must know the old idea and the new context. To create a new solution, you must first understand the problem and have researched current solutions. Creativity is all about using content as a tool to move learning forward.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>In terms of thinking itself, creativity is grounded on all the other thinking skills (which have already been taught explicitly), so they begin the task knowing a lot (high chance for success, which is the greatest motivator). Risk of failure is small, thinking "outside the box" is valued and diversity is a benefit to creating original ideas and perspectives.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Since many students see the task itself as relevant, that means they also interact with the content more (time, effort, resources), which deepens their content knowledge and connections (a positive spiral).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Brainstorming rules are the foundation for many other creativity strategies: 1) No criticism is allowed; 2) the focus is on quantity; 3) the wilder the idea is the better; and 4) hitchhiking is OK (Davis, 2004). The tough part when being creative is to not judge ideas as they are said/written. Your "bad" idea might be the one idea that sparks an amazing idea in someone else. When brainstorming, perseverance is key-people must develop the disposition (and confidence) that they can in fact come up with many ideas or solutions.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Diversity of personal experiences is also a strength when being creative because people who are very different than you probably also have access to different life experiences, concepts and definitions than you do. That means that your group combinations can be more unique, more original and more workable! It pays to be creative with a diverse group (really).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>It is becoming more and more obvious that the answers we grew up with in our industrialized society are not necessarily going to be the answers in tomorrow's world. Creativity is not a unitary ability, but is rather made up of a number of abilities: sensitivity to problems, fluency, flexibility, originality, elaboration and redefinition (Torrance, 1979). Everyone can increase their creativity when viewed with this perspective.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Teaching creativity requires that the teacher understand that opposition does exist to creativity. There are emotional roadblocks-fear of new ideas, the loss of comfort in knowing the one right answer and even the sense of belonging to people who think the same way you do. Cultural blocks, like social influence, expectations and conformity, also play a major role in stifling creativity, especially in schools.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="110" id="mark-c16ddbad-374f-4c5e-8e1a-ed3eb98afd25" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Finally, mental blocks exist: habits, jumping to conclusions rather than looking for alternatives, and the opposition between creative changes and stabilizing forces. Also, the emphasis in schools themselves on recall, and the reproduction of a particular pattern of thinking or behavior, all combine to make the teaching of creativity an interesting experience.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For most school work, teachers can hope for originality but that isn't really the point of Creativity as a Thinking Question. The point of thinking creatively is the personalization of learning (and content understanding). Using information (what you think you know in theory) as a jumping-off point for further learning allows each learner the opportunity to wallow in the content as they try to figure something out (creativity is messy). They search for new ways and new perspectives, grapple with definitions and make connections to prior thoughts, beliefs and actions.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Finally, people who rate themselves as "highly creative" are also ranked high on self-actualization scale. If we want to grow our students into self-actualized participants in a democratic society, helping them learn to be more creative just seems to make sense (to us).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Classroom Examples:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">List 50 ways to test the effectiveness of a fruit.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">In what ways might we modify this story line for a new setting?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">What ideas do you have for designing a conflict so that war would be inevitable after five years?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">List 100 ideas for a new song title.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Rachel has participated fully in her group's brainstorming task.

They consider multiple criteria and put those ideas together to decide what to actually do.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="113" id="mark-ded3b5c6-0b8e-4eb2-bb73-4c21cbf784a3" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>"Expertness" comes from: lots of prior experiences, lots of reflection about those experiences (analysis and appraisal), decisions made (or not made) and their consequences, and the rigorous study of the field. Experts do in fact "know" stuff. They have evaluations based upon field-appropriate criteria rather than opinions.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Any major type of decision requires the use of multiple criteria. Buying a house? Think location, size, schools nearby, space, neighbors, plumbing, electricity . . . Wow - a realtor needs to consider many criteria. Same for buying a car (or van or truck, etc.). In fact, for most things we intend to purchase we almost always use many criteria (all very quickly and mostly implicitly).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The problem is when we attempt to "teach" critical thinking, we need to make those invisible criteria Explicit for our students. How can we hope to help them "think like an expert" if they do not know how an expert thinks (what they consider)?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Not only do they not know the criteria an expert uses, but they also do not know how they use them to make a final choice. This idea of identifying expert criteria and then using them to make a choice is a life-changing skill for our students.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>People tell/expect students to be: thoughtful and rational, show good judgment, and pick wisely, but don't teach them how to do those tasks. It's as if adults assume students intentionally make bad choices. No-they did the best they could using the criteria and decision-making skills they had at that time.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Frequently our students do not consider:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Options/alternatives that exist (the creativity portion of any situation),</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">The criteria that connect your choice to your overall goal, and</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Criteria that an expert would use.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Thinking like an expert (in terms of decision making) is complex when you do not have lots and lots of experiences, and even harder if you have never thought about what determines the quality of the thing in question. It is even hard for us who have multiple experiences with something-but we see those experiences from a different perspective.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="114" id="mark-c54272b8-5b2e-4456-aec9-12b6c048da07" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><span style="display: inline;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Living in a house does not truly prepare you to be an expert house “buyer” (just like being a student does not prepare you for being a teacher!) A change in perspective matters—it requires a total “Re-think” of your experiences (and lots of focused learning experiences as well).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>What can help is talking with experts and finding out what criteria they consider and how they use them together to make a decision. The difference between advice and information is advice tells you what you should do (the decision you should make), and information says that experts consider these ideas, information or criteria when making that kind of decision.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Criteria for any decision is complicated because they're so context specific. That means that a major change to the context changes how the criteria are applied. For example, one criteria that many of us may use when buying a car would be money. Change how much money you can spend and you fundamentally change the context (and maybe/probably the decision you make).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>That means that what might be the "right" criteria at one time may not be right at another time; the context has changed. Understanding your criteria gives you a chance to think into the future-what would you choose with different criteria?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Ultimately, using Critical Thinking as a TQ is a prediction tool. When selecting anything you are predicting the best choice for yourself (it will best meet your needs at that time and place). You are saying that out of all the ideas you have created, using these criteria as most important, this one thing will best meet your needs.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Prediction based upon "thinking" is complex and contextual. It is not focused on The One Right Answer; it is focused on developing the thinking pattern that leads to a rationale for the decision.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>People who think critically, when asked why they made that specific choice,answer,"I considered <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="12" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c58"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2C"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-texatom space="2" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c59"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="normal">X</mi></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="normal">Y</mi></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> and <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="13" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c5A"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="normal">Z</mi></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> ," and then explain how they "considered those ideas (the pros and cons of each)," and finally used that thinking to select their number one idea.

Time pressures, content exams, and school curriculums all point to the need to "cover" certain content. What if we could have students act like experts in the field-and make sure those actions are grounded in appropriate content?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Acting like an expert in any field includes: specific facts and knowledge, special skills directly related to what an expert actually does every day, and those dispositions that an expert would actually demonstrate on a daily basis. To DO something like an expert means to constantly Re-think, Re-visualize and Re-conceptualize what they think they know, can do and believe, using information as needed.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>By using action as the culminating Thinking Question, you do not sacrifice content-you increase it.

By this point students will have: multiple concrete experiences (the triangles) with the concept focal point (the circle), have analyzed (pie pieces), appraised (different size pie pieces), summarized (the small circle), and evaluated the pieces and important ideas (the star). They will also have thought about new ways of thinking and doing things (infinity) and then picked their very best idea (starburst) to Plan and Implement (hexagon puzzle piece). Their Plan and Implementation must be grounded in how the field goes about doing what they will be DOing!</div></div></div><div><br><!-- Media --><br></div><div><div><div>Action Thinking Question Cue Words: Plan Outline Steps Web Sequence Write Followed by "Do it now!"</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Action helps the individual translate theory into practice, and that is an important bridge to create. It is always easy to think, "I can do that," or "I could do that if I wanted to," yet experts in any field make the challenging appear easy. Experts have practiced their craft over and over again, sought new information, and used each experience to create new and deeper understandings. They constantly Re-view, Re-vise and Re-think what they currently do, know and believe.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Experts take their number one idea (using appropriate/expert criteria), plan their next task or performance, and DO it for real (not just in their heads). They might: write the script for their number one idea-then perform it; design their number one experiment-then conduct it; or create their number one new game-then play it. And even as they are DOing it, they are already considering ways to make it better (a continual Re-think mentality).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For our students (and all those curricular expectations), action also needs to be directly aligned with the original concept development idea. Knowledge (facts), skills, and dispositions must be experienced, explained, and assessed so that students may act in ways that extend their thinking, build new skills and their deepest beliefs.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="118" id="mark-116c910e-dbc8-4c8d-902f-09676307501b" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Action (grounded in experiences and information) requires a two-step thinking process: (1) Planning and (2) Doing.</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Planning includes the WWWWWH (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) features of any task. It includes the: materials, time estimates, resources that will be needed (and obtained), the process (steps) that will be followed, task or job allocations, communication strategies, checkpoints, evaluations and assessments, and the alignment of the task to the final assessment criteria.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>And</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="2">Doing the plan! This step of course requires constant Re-visions and adjustments toward the assessment criteria. Plans are not the reality of the thing. Constant checkpoints, the gathering of more information, modifications of the plan, and cutting and pasting are all normal features of any DOing task.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>DOing makes theory come alive. Sounds easy to use Civil War methods to bake some bread? Now grind it-by hand-find some yeast, build the fire, then bake the bread. Want to get a paper published? Find the magazine, follow their steps, submit the written paper, then wait (up to six weeks).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>DOing things is fun and challenging (and that's a good thing). We value (an emotion) things that we have struggled to accomplish. Overcoming the struggles makes the learning journey worthwhile. The enactment of the plan is a major part of the journey.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>One other thing about plans: They almost never turn out the way we anticipate! Plans are our "first best guess" about how things will go. In reality (DOing the plan) we almost always have to Re-think, Re-plan, and Reorganize. Yet, having a plan is crucial to success (as long as we see the plan as a work-in-progress).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>One of the beauties about DOing is that the end product is worth sharing-with other classes, parents/guardians, other teachers, board members and community members. It says, "This is what I have created!" Action allows for a concrete product and proves to the self what has been learned. "I did this," and "I learned this!"</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="119" id="mark-fb5f3998-f0d2-441f-b570-9794661435c7" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Student actions demonstrate the depth of their conceptual knowledge of the concept you had them experience at the beginning. Their actions integrate the knowledge,skills and dispositions (back to part I) you were hoping to help them learn. Action as part of Thinking Questions is:</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Content heavy (facts and connections),</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Skill heavy (repetition and practice), and</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Disposition heavy (think like an expert in the field).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Finally, action also completes the learning cycle! The entire Thinking Question sequence started with concrete experiences-and ends with concrete experiences (at a more sophisticated level). Students now know more, can do more and are more aware of the dispositions that reflect their deepest beliefs. When taught Explicitly and Intentionally, the Thinking Question sequence helps them build their self-confidence and moves them toward self-awareness.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Classroom Examples:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Compose your number one poem and present it to the school during our annual Poetry Slam.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Now plan and create your own authentic wax museum for presentation in two weeks.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Write the rules for your new game, which your parents will play at our next open house.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">Plan and Conduct your own experiment and then write it up for binding and presentation in the school library.</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Eventually, the students settle on a plan. Mr. James approves their Civil War event-a small battle in the South that causes a family to lose their home and barn. They write their script for the aftermath of the event. Ramone plays the farmer's son, Jack the Captain whose force caused the buildings to burn, Sarah the girlfriend of the soldier who lit the house on fire, and Rachel the widowed mother of the farmer.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="120" id="mark-1dcf3806-595f-4b3e-b8b5-c91fd923222f" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>They each get very excited about their role play, for very different reasons: Sarah has always wanted to try her hand at writing and directing a script; Jack-this is what he lives for; Ramone-he gets to shift from a supporting role on the football team to being the key figure in the role play; and Rachel-playing a mother figure gives her a chance to imagine what her mother might actually be thinking. They are each committed to their own learning.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>All knowledge is personal knowledge - and is not the same thing as the accumulation of information (factoids). Personal knowledge is the interaction between information and the human experience. I get to choose what I believe, the skills I learn, and the information that I think matters most (to me, at that time and at that place).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>DOing something that is grounded in what an expert might do requires that I "think like an expert." Most experts produce things that have an external audience. Experts demonstrate their learning to a knowledgeable audience (even if it's just other experts in the field), which has its own type(s) of pressure. Performances are exciting (and scary and nerve wracking and worthwhile and fun!).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>DOing something with a concept that students have experienced, studied, summarized, compared, and ranked allows them to create their own "knowledge" about that concept. They have been the ones to do the thinking-Re-visiting their own experiences as well as new information.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Last night Mr. James' class had an open house and parents, guardians, and other family members came and watched class members on video recordings act out their Meeting-of-the-Mind Role Plays. Almost all the students were excited to showcase their learning and most everyone left feeling proud of their accomplishments.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>It was fun for Mr. James to see the students interact with the adults who could make the event, and he gave students whose parents/guardians could not attend the YouTube link and a CD so they could share at home. School administrators were impressed by both the video recordings and how many parents and guardians came to watch.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="121" id="mark-1b01ba80-3962-42af-9107-788668f0cf96" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Today Mr. James chats with the class.

How well have they connected those facts into personal knowledge?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Skills: Have they learned how to triangulate information, find and take the source into account, see multiple perspectives about any event, distinguish between fact and fiction, and see things without 20/20 hindsight?</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Dispositions: Have they learned how to think like `"historians,"` create action plans and follow them through, look for multiple right answers, and come to own their own learning?</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James teaches people (rather than history). He takes them from where they are and moves them over on their own personal learning (and life) journey.

ACTION-PLAN AND DO</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Backwards Design (Wiggins and McTighe, 1998) emphasizes knowing what you want students to have learned at the end of the unit before you start any other planning. That means you know what Final Tasks the students will be working toward and how you will Assess those tasks before you begin any other planning. Beginning with the end-in-mind also means to consider both Content and making learning Relevant for your students.</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>Final Tasks</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>The Final Tasks for any unit of instruction need to be worthy of sharing with an external audience, allow students to personalize content facts and allow for creative ways of thinking about their learning (new perspectives, new connections and new insights).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>When the Task at hand is interesting to students they give of their time, efforts and resources. They are said to be "motivated" because they are engaged in their own learning.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James thinks about his storytelling skills with the Three Little Pigs. His kids love his voices, his verbals and nonverbals, and love to participate in his storytelling. He decides to have his students become storytellers of different perspectives—about people who experienced the Civil War from different perspectives; blacks, whites, Northerners, Southerners, mothers, fathers, old, young, rich, poor, educated, and not formally educated.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="126" id="mark-147e6e20-474d-43eb-8207-9ff9c7e8eb51" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><span style="display: inline;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>He also decides to have them write their histories and put them together into a text for others. Mr. James decides that doing "papers" only for the teacher does not allow students to share their learning with their parents—and certainly not with the community. Not only that, but knowing your piece will be published and displayed for others to see adds some pressure to doing a good job <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="14" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2299"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>⊙</mo></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> !</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Finally, he decides to invite parents and community members into his class and watch students interact with each other as they role play the people they have written their stories about. He plans to video record these "Meeting of the Mind" dialogues and invite parents to watch their children perform their roles. He will ask his students to showcase their learning to the people who care most about them-what could be more relevant than that?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Deciding upon the Final Task allows the teacher to make coherent curricular and learning decisions with those Final Tasks in mind. This content-In (needed for the Final Task). This content-Out (interesting but not helpful to the Final Task). This Learning Activity-In (makes explicit a required Knowledge, Skill or Disposition). This Learning Activity-Out (Fun but not crucial at this time).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Focusing on the Final Task allows the teacher to make instructional choices that are both Explicit and Intentional.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Assessments: Assessments and Evaluations tell everyone where to focus their efforts, that these Facts, these Skills and these Dispositions matter. They matter so much they will assessed and evaluated both during and at the end of the unit.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Knowledge: Mr. James knows the importance of the AP exam to students, parents and the administration. He also realizes that there is more to history than the accumulation of facts (from one perspective).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>He plans to create a list of the most important facts from the AP exam and content standards and tell the students right up front what those are. He then plans to have them use those facts in their perspective stories. He will also give a content exam at the end of the unit to make sure they know those facts.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="127" id="mark-f5e1d3ea-d867-447b-a11f-276e88d5e122" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Skills: Writing a "history" of an event from a person's perspective will allow him to teach "historical writing" skills. Triangulation, primary sources, format, voice and context are all important features of historical writings. He will expect them to provide context for their person, an individual perspective of an event he will choose, and to write with that framework rather than the 20/20 hindsight version of their current perspectives.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Dispositions: Mr. James also wants his students to develop their "history dispositions." He wants to allow them to see that there are multiple right perspectives of any event and that studying history does not mean to always judge historical figures. Context matters- and the development of empathy rests upon the foundation of seeing things from another person's point of view.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Finally Mr. James plans to talk with his students after all the assessments are complete. He wants to "debrief" their experiences (from all their perspectives) so they can create a shared knowledge about what their learning journey entailed. He knows that each product is in fact its own experience (a triangle) and they are then able to start a new learning journey with an experience that has shaped their thinking.</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>2. CONCEPT IDENTIFICATION</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>For content issues, backwards design includes looking over your school curriculum (if you have one and actually know where it is!), the AP exam itself (or at least the notes they let you see), and local, state, and national standards. Everyone it seems wants to tell you what content to teach, and every year it seems the list gets longer and longer.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Fortunately, in every content area there are some ideas that hold the field together. Those ideas are called things like: Central Concepts, Themes, Big Ideas, Threads, Strands, etc. What they all refer to are those simple, Big (enduring) ideas that cut across all the disciplines within one field (appendix D).</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>For example, in science one Big Idea is that of energy. That means when scientists talk about cellular respiration (energy) in biology, they can also connect that idea to reactions in chemistry (energy) and plate tectonics in geology (energy). The Big Ideas allow teachers to "connect" concepts (the circle in the diagrams) from one discipline to another, and help students realize that what they have already learned is still useful and important. Prior learning acts as the foundation for future learning, in whatever discipline!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="128" id="mark-829aedf5-f2d1-429d-894a-d327bbdee2c6" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>Note 1: All the details (facts) that everyone wants students to "know" really just illuminate and add detail to the central concepts of the field.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Note 2: Since the Big Ideas in any field (i.e., energy in science) cut across all the disciplines (biology, chemistry, etc.), the teacher has the option to emphasize any central concept for any specific content. For example, a teacher could use the Civil War to teach about people (our example) or resources, or power, or time, etc. What the teacher ultimately assesses tells everyone which Big Idea they are working on at this point in time.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James decides that the concept he will focus on for his unit will be People (a Social Studies Central Concept). Not just people in general but how each individual has their own Perspective about any event that takes place. He believes he can connect those ideas to helping his students develop their ability to be empathetic-a relevant topic for many of his students trying to understand their peers.</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>Content Choice</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Every teacher is required by their school to teach specific content, and most teachers like the content anyway. Content is in fact important because thinking requires something to think about.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Mr. James has decided to focus on the Civil War as his content platform. It is a section on the AP exam, all the standards mention it, and besides that he is a Civil War buff and knows some parents and community groups that do Civil War reenactments.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>He believes that he can use that event to "teach" the Big Idea of "People." Thinking about the Three Little Pigs, he wants to help his students realize there are many different Perspectives to any single event.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="129" id="mark-8114e2eb-8f64-4b05-b067-42d5751fa226" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>CHAPTER 19</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>He also decides that what he really wants to have his students learn is how to think "like a historian." He wants to help them put together a "history thinking template" for studying different events in time. He believes that helping them learn to "think like a historian" will be an investment of time rather than a cost. They will be able to use their "history thinking template" over and over again-knowing what counts (to historians).</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>Relevance and Content</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Creating lessons that make learning "relevant" requires understanding what needs (Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs) your students have right now, today. It means using content as the vehicle to teach students something important, something that will "enhance their Quality of Life" right now-not some far-off day in the future.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Fortunately, DOing what experts in any field actually do is pretty interesting. Writing/Creating plays, finding a pattern that explains a set of phenomena, finding an answer to a question you have, or creating a workout that works for you-things that experts DO also seem to meet people's needs.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The interesting thing about DOing what experts do is that those actions are grounded in facts (knowledge) and skills. In other words you need to know some stuff (content) to DO what they do (skills). Want to fish? Better know some stuff about fish, and fishing gear and strategies. Want to write a play? Better know some stuff about the concept for the play and how to structure your writing. Want to illuminate a pattern of events? Better know about representations and operations.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>The beauty of DOing activities is that the content you learn makes sense to you. You need to know those facts to accomplish your task, not just because someone told you to memorize those factoids. We all know lots and lots of facts about things we love to do-in fact sometimes it is scary how much "trivia" we know about our hobbies and interests.</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>3. EXPERIENCE CHOICES</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>Once you as teacher have developed a good sense of what you want for your students at the end of the unit, your teaching dilemma becomes "What concrete, three-dimensional experiences do I need to provide so that their thinking (concept development) is grounded in personal experiences rather than information filtered by many others?"</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="130" id="mark-a1f88ba2-540a-4933-a32e-ce10e4401f7d" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>The most challenging realization is that those concrete experiences you provide will be the basis for all the other thinking questions you will ask-from induction to creativity. The student's final project will ultimately be the extension of thought from those very basic, very foundational personal experiences.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Going back to the Experiences diagram, it is important to realize those experiences (plural) need to include their senses, access their different ways of processing that input, and have an emotional component to make it memorable, all while helping make their mental models (of thought) explicit to them.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>So Mr. James decides to start the unit with the following six experiences:</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Diaries and letters from a wide variety of people involved in the Civil War as well as audiotapes of slaves from that time period.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Newspapers, magazines, and ads from that time period.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Food and drinks from that time period (they will have to use a Civil War recipe and make something to share in class).</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">A medical kit, glasses, and sickness remedies from that time period (as well as death and wounded statistics).</li></ol><br><ol><li value="5">Song lyrics, musical instruments, and a Civil War dance.</li></ol><br><ol><li value="6">Clothes, transportation devices, and delivery schedules. Everyone has to wear a period costume during class (thanks to the reenactment group and the theatre department).</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Good thinking requires powerful experiences and information to think about! Those powerful concrete experiences become the "memory hook" that ties information together and allows students to make their own knowledge.</div></div></div><div><br></div><h2><div><div>FINAL NOTE: EXPERIENCES AND ACTION</div></div></h2><div><br></div><div><div><div>We are all functions of our life experiences (with a genetic twist). Having a powerful life experience fundamentally changes who you are. The key to CHAPTER 19 creating the "Art" of teaching thinking is connecting the experiences you provide, plus the ones they already have toward your end-in-mind for their learning.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="131" id="mark-3adfc54c-679d-4c7e-a018-be7bb47ce472" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><div><br><br></div><div><div><div>The Art of teaching thinking means the experiences you provide have to 1) be robust enough; 2) be diverse enough; and 3) set students up for success at the end (write a history and role play their person from history). Will those experiences you have provided allow for a deep and complex conversation about "perspectives"? Will those experiences be so diverse that easy answers will be hard to find? Will there be enough commonality so that the concept of Perspective and People becomes their frame of reference?</div></div></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>Those thoughts, decisions, and planning will determine the quality of their historical writings and their ability to role play their person with honesty and thoughtfulness. ⑳</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="132" id="mark-02d293ca-1ef5-44fa-967a-d46f416bda40" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="133" id="mark-91d93710-d897-4cfd-9cc0-92c851d317b3" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="134" id="mark-bb4616e4-2dcb-4eca-8a12-b5a18c607c62" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="135" id="mark-a1e519c6-7dfc-45e8-81f2-90fd586bd430" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="136" id="mark-75966401-9aa0-482f-938f-a7741d1ab953" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="137" id="mark-16116ef8-b9b8-4313-b43f-e4063c364859" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="138" id="mark-f775aa84-161b-488a-8cb7-c04efa414d32" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="139" id="mark-63d36d70-5b1a-4619-aa1a-fdc799e43c0e" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="140" id="mark-8b32a7e3-a3c8-4501-97d3-0ac6381f7282" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="141" id="mark-f6f5ef92-356b-43c1-9b2b-2f03771be23e" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div style="height: auto;"><span style="display: inline;"><div><br><br><ol><li value="1">Communication</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Representations</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Relationships</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">Operations</li></ol><br></div><div><div><div>Music</div></div></div><div><br><ol><li value="1">Time (beat/pulse, meter, rhythm)</li></ol><br><ol><li value="2">Pitch</li></ol><br><ol><li value="3">Melody</li></ol><br><ol><li value="4">Harmony</li></ol><br><ol><li value="5">Text</li></ol><br><ol><li value="6">Form</li></ol><br><ol><li value="7">Expression (tempo, timbre, texture, dynamics, articulation)</li></ol><br></div><h2><div><div><mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="9" style="font-size: 117%;
