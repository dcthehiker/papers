<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In the past two decades, there has been a sudden increase of inquiry
within the branch of analytic philosophy on the nature and role of
intuition in philosophy. Philosophers began to investigate what
intuition is, how it should be defined, what role it plays in
philosophy, what its epistemic status is and many more. There is also a
growing number of philosophers arguing that the whole debate rests on a
mistake: intuition in philosophy plays no role whatsoever and
philosophers do not use it as (a source of) evidence for their
philosophical claims. This strategy is often conducted by
differentiating among the two senses in which intuition is supposed to
play an evidential role in philosophy. Intuition, thus, can be
understood as a state of intuiting something or a propositional content
that is intuited. Intuition in the first sense, the argument goes,
cannot be treated as evidence as it would present the risk of
psychologizing evidence in philosophy. If, however, we take intuition as
evidence in the second sense, there is nothing distinctive about it:
ultimately, all evidence in philosophy is of propositional nature,
regardless of the intuitiveness of a given proposition.</p>
<p>In my paper, I argue that this strategy fails and propose, instead,
the view on intuition that, firstly, explains why the aforementioned
distinction does not render the intuitiveness of the content irrelevant
to its epistemic status, secondly, is in accord with the current
findings in psychology, and, thirdly, is minimal enough to allow the
different views of intuitions to be incorporated under that umbrella. In
particular, I argue that it is an intuitive judgment, characterized by
its non-inferentiality and defeasibility, that serves as evidence for
particular philosophical claims, while its source is an intuition
understood as a state of non-propositional character that can be
examined empirically.</p>

<h2 id="resumen">Resumen</h2>
<p>En las dos últimas décadas, se ha producido dentro de la filosofía
analítica un aumento repentino de la investigación sobre la naturaleza y
el papel que juea la intuición. Los filósofos empezaron a investigar qué
es la intuición, cómo debería definirse, qué papel desempeña en la
filosofía, cuál es su estatus epistémico, entre otras cosas. También hay
un número creciente de filósofos que sostienen que todo el debate se
basa en un error: la intuición en filosofía no desempeña papel alguno y
los filósofos no la utilizan como (fuente de) prueba para sus
afirmaciones filosóficas. Esta estrategia se lleva a cabo a menudo
diferenciando entre los dos sentidos en los que se supone que la
intuición desempeña un papel evidencial en filosofia. Así, la intuición
puede entenderse como un estado de intuir o como un contenido
proposicional que se intuye. En el primer sentido, se argumenta, la
intuición no puede ser tratada como evidencia, ya que presentaría el
riesgo de psicologizar la evidencia en filosofía. Sin embargo, si
tomamos la intuición como evidencia en el segundo sentido, no hay nada
distintivo en ella: en última instancia, toda evidencia en filosofía es
de naturaleza proposicional, independientemente de la intuitividad de
una proposición dada.</p>
<p>En mi artículo, sostengo que esta estrategia fracasa y propongo, en
su lugar, una visión de la intuición que, en primer lugar, explica por
qué la distinción mencionada no hace que la intuitividad del contenido
sea irrelevante para su estatus epistémico; en segundo lugar, está de
acuerdo con los hallazgos actuales en psicología; y, en tercer lugar, es
lo suficientemente mínima como para permitir la incorporación de las
diferentes perspectivas sobre las intuiciones. En particular, sostengo
que un juicio intuitivo, caracterizado por su no inferencialidad y
revocabilidad, sirve de prueba para determinadas afirmaciones
filosóficas, mientras que su fuente es una intuición entendida como un
estado de carácter no proposicional que puede examinarse
empíricamente.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Arguably, one of the distinctive features of roughly the first two
decades of the 21st century philosophy is the attention philosophers pay
to metaphilosophical issues. While many areas of metaphilosophical
inquiries were of philosophers’ interest during that period, one that
stands out as a particularly hot topic concerns the nature and role of
intuition in philosophical practice. There have been tons of papers and
although there seems to be no consensus on even how to define intuition,
some very general strategies and the most popular approaches can be
marked out. Particularly, when it comes to the question of the role of
intuition, some philosophers claim that intuition has a heavy epistemic
credence and can be often relied on, while others doubt that and call
for a revision (or even rejection) of Kamil Cekiera intuition-driven
methodologies of philosophy. Yet, for some others this whole debate
seems to be utterly misguided as it is based on the assumption they deem
false - that intuition plays any role in philosophy whatsoever.</p>
<p>Philosophers denying intuition any role in philosophy, which -
following Nado (2016) - I will dub Intuition Deniers, very often argue
for that claim differentiating between two senses in which intuition is
supposed to play an evidential role in philosophy. Intuition, thus, can
be understood either as a state of intuiting something or a
propositional content that is intuited. According to the Intuition
Deniers’ argument (see especially Williamson, 2007; Deutsch, 2015),
intuition in the first sense cannot be treated as evidence as it would
threaten the risk of psychologizing evidence in philosophy. If, however,
we take intuition to be evidence in the second sense, there is nothing
distinctive about it: ultimately, all evidence in philosophy is of
propositional nature, regardless of the intuitiveness of a given
proposition.</p>
<p>In this paper, I am going to argue that such an argumentative
strategy fails as the aforementioned distinction does not render the
intuitiveness of the content irrelevant to its epistemic status.
Instead, I will propose a broadly non-inferential view on intuition that
explains why intuition is, in fact, treated as (a source of) evidence in
philosophy and is coherent with current findings in cognitive science
and psychology, while at the same time is minimal enough to serve as an
umbrella term for a variety of diverse theories of intuition in
philosophy. For that purpose, I will proceed as follows. In the second
section I will briefly sketch what the whole debate is about. In the
third, I will present the Intuition Deniers’ charge of psychologizing
the evidence in philosophy. My answer to that challenge will be
presented in the fourth section. In the last two sections I will propose
my own view on the evidential role of intuition. In the fifth I will
argue for the view that while the propositional content of intuition is
used as evidence in philosophy, the state of intuiting is the source of
that evidence. Finally in the sixth, I will present my minimal view on
intuition in philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="intuition-in-philosophy">2. Intuition in philosophy</h2>
<p>The notion of intuition has been of philosophers’ interest for
centuries. <span class="math inline"><sup>1</sup></span> Even a quick
glance suffices for realizing that the term was used to cover a
comprehensive and often inconsistent range of phenomena: some took it to
be a form of direct comprehension of things, others as a kind of
non-discursive cognition or as grasping of self-evident propositions.
The list could be considerably extended - as rightly observed by Jaakko
Hintikka, when we take a look at the old-time philosophers’ works, “what
is remarkable about their usage [of the term ’intuition’] is its broad
scope” (Hintikka,2003,p. 169). <span

<p>For the last two decades or so, there has been an outburst of
metaphilosophical papers on intuition in philosophy. Regardless of the
question (interesting in itself) about the roots of such a sudden
concern, <span class="math inline"><sup>3</sup></span> it is important
to point out what kind of phenomena are taken to be paradigmatic
examples of intuition. In the relevant context, a typical instance of
intuition is a (spontaneous) verdict or judgment on a given thought
experiment. <span class="math inline"><sup>4</sup></span> To illustrate
it with a typical example, in his famous 1963 paper, Edmund Gettier
comes up with two thought experiments to argue against the account of
knowledge as justified true belief. He presents two stories in which the
protagonist has certain justified and true belief but judges that the
protagonist nevertheless lacks knowledge. As there are not any
additional pieces of evidence to support that conclusion, <span
class="math inline"><sup>5</sup></span> it is standardly assumed that
such judgment is based on intuition and thus intuition plays a crucial
evidential role here.</p>
<p>The general structure of similar usages of thought experiments in
philosophy can be reconstructed as proceeding in the following four
steps: <span class="math inline"><sup>6</sup></span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Given concept <span class="math inline">C/</span> relation or
property <span class="math inline">C</span> being introduced</p></li>
<li><p>Stating the set of jointly necessary and sufficient conditions of
falling under the concept <span class="math inline">C/</span> being in
the relation or having the property <span class="math inline">C</span>
(or simply: the definition of C)</p></li>
<li><p>Hypothetical scenario <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>
in which the conditions stated in the step 2 are met</p></li>
<li><p>Actual question of the thought experiment: does <span

</ol>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>3</sup></span> The scope of this paper
does not allow to address that question with proper attention.
Nevertheless,it is worth pointing out two important dates: the
publication of a very influential monograph Rethinking intuition
containing many wide-commented papers (see DePaul and Ramsey, 1998), and
the rise of the so-called experimental philosophy movement, which
provoked many discussions on the role of intuition in philosophy - in
that respect, the paper Normativity and epistemic intuitions (see
Weinberg, Nichols and Stich, 2001) is usually considered a pioneering
one.</p>
<p>4 The label “thought experiment” is meant to be understood broadly,
that is to cover all instances of the so-called method of cases, and not
in a more restricted manner characteristic for some thought experiments’
theoreticians (e.g. Bealer, 1998) who take thought experiments to be
akin to the real (that is, empirical) ones.</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>5</sup></span> Although Deutsch (2010;
2015) claims that in fact in his paper Gettier does argue further for
that conclusion, the standard interpretation is that Gettier does not
provide any further argumentation. For the lack of space, I will not
dwell on why I disagree with Deutsch and, instead, I will just assume
that, in this case, the majority’s view prevails.</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>6</sup></span> For more on that
model,see Cekiera (2023).</p>

<p>Kamil Cekiera</p>
<p>The outcome of a thought experiment hinges crucially on step 4 - that
is, on the verdict on the actual question of a thought experiment.
Moreover, intuition is taken to be a source of such judgment; hence
intuition is decisive of success of a given thought experiment or lack
thereof.</p>
<p>Now, although most philosophers tend to agree with that general
picture of the intuition-induced method of philosophy, they remain quite
diversified as to what is the nature of intuition in question. As Serena
Maria Nicoli nicely sums up:</p>
<p>(…) in spite of the disagreement on the characterization of
‘intuition’, a common ground for those interested in methodological
questions may be identified. What they all acknowledge is that (1)
verdicts expressed at the end of the so-called thought experiments (TEs)
are examples of the kind of judgements we are interested in, and that
(2) philosophers, whether legitimately or not, do in fact use
‘judgements about cases’ to build, support or attack theories. (Nicoli,
2016, p. 10)</p>
<p>Thus, a common ground is the paradigmatic examples of the use of
intuition and its epistemic role for (de)constructing philosophical
theories. What philosophers differ about is how to characterize
intuition properly. One popular answer is the one assumed by Nicoli:
that intuition is a kind of judgment or broadly some type of
propositional attitude. For instance, some take intuition to be
tantamount to just certain belief or opinion (e.g. Lewis, 1983, p. x;
Van Inwagen, 1997, p. 309; Sorensen, 1992, p. 43), while others claim
that intuition should be defined in terms of an inclination or
disposition to believe (e.g. Sosa, 1996; 1998; 2007; Earlenbaugh and
Molyneux, 2009, p. 36). Such doxastic accounts may also include
competence-based understandings of intuition. According to that view,
formulating an intuitive judgment is just to exercising one’s conceptual
competence (e.g. Ludwig, 2007; 2010; Sgaravatti, 2015). Thus, confronted
with thought experiment, a competent speaker will formulate an
appropriate intuitive judgment on the basis of her understanding and
conceptual competence. As a consequence, in the case of conflicting
judgments, only one intuition will be a genuine one: “there might be a
conflict of judgments about the case, but there cannot be a conflict of
intuitions” (Ludwig, 2010, p. 436).</p>
<p>Another group of theories takes intuition to be of non-doxastic
nature, one that is more akin to sui generis experience than to
proposition or propositional attitude. According to that view, what
distinguishes intuition is its accompanying phenomenology
(e.g. Chudnoff, 2013; Bengson, 2015; Koksvik, 2017). Intuition,
therefore, does not only represent things as being in a certain way, but
also (intellectually) presents them to be in such a way. Moreover,
although intuition is not of a propositional character, it provides a
justification for holding certain belief (cf. Chudnoff, 2013, Part II).
In a similar vein, some philosophers (see, for example, Bealer, 1996;
1998; 2008) - take intuition to be simply a kind of intellectual seeming
that justifies one in judging something to be the case.</p>
<p>This very much perfunctory outline of different possible views on the
nature of intuition in philosophy is far from being exhaustive. Instead,
it is meant to indicate that regardless of Kamil Cekiera what exactly
one takes intuition to be, it will eventually come down to one of the
two broad groups. Either intuition is of a propositional nature (be it a
judgment, belief, disposition to belief or some other form of
propositional attitude) or experience-like (intellectual seeming or
phenomenological insight as characterized by presentational nature of
intuition). This distinction bears on a different one, that Intuition
Deniers often use to challenge the idea of evidential status of
intuition.</p>
<h3 id="the-intuiting-and-the-intuited">3.The intuiting and the
intuited</h3>
<p>It is often claimed that there is an ambiguity in the assertion
‘intuition is used as evidence in philosophy’. It can be understood
either as a claim that the fact that someone has an intuition is taken
as evidence or that the propositional content of such intuition is the
evidence for a given theory or claim. Sometimes the distinction is
labelled as the one between the intuiting and the intuited (Pust, 2001,
p. 230; 2019) or between the state and the content (Deutsch, 2015,
p. 36). Such two senses of intuition go, of course, in pair with two
understandings of the nature of intuition as sketched in the previous
section. <span class="math inline"><sup>7</sup></span> The distinction
has,however, far-reaching consequences for the discussion of the role of
intuition in philosophical practice.</p>
<p>This is so because some Intuition Deniers take that distinction to
undermine the significance of intuition in philosophy. Roughly, they
argue as follows. If intuition is used as evidence in philosophy, it is
either the intuiting or the intuited that is putative evidence. If it is
the latter, then the claim becomes trivial: philosophy is a discursive
practice, hence obviously a bulk of philosophical evidence will consist
of propositional content of a various sort. The fact that particular
content is intuited remains irrelevant to the truth or falsity of a
given proposition. On the other hand, if it is the former, then it risks
the charge of psychologizing evidence. That objection was formulated
most vocally by Timothy Williamson, according to whom contemporary
analytic philosophers</p>
<p>think that, in philosophy, ultimately our evidence consists only of
intuitions (…). Under pressure, they take that to mean not that our
evidence consists of the mainly nonpsychological putative facts which
are the contents of those intuitions, but that it consists of the
psychological facts to the effect that we have intuitions with those
contents, true or false. On such a view, our evidence in philosophy
amounts only to psychological facts about ourselves. Nevertheless, they
do not want the psychological fact that we have an intuition that <span
class="math inline">P</span> to be perfectly neutral with respect to the
nonpsychological question whether <span class="math inline">P</span>
,for that leads to skepticism about philosophy. If we merely seek the
best explanation of our having the intuitions, without any presumption
in favor Kamil Cekiera of their truth, we may find a psychological
theory to explain them, but how are we to answer the questions about a
mainly non-psychological universe that grip many metaphysicians and
other philosophers? (Williamson, 2007, pp. 235-236)</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>7</sup></span> It is not meant to
claim that those two distinctions are tantamount to each other. It is
rather a trivial observation that they are crisscrossed: philosophers
claiming that intuition has a non-doxastic nature will be more
interested in the state (the intuiting), while those holding that
intuition is of doxastic character will arguably focus on the content
(the intuited). Thanks to an anonymous referee for pressing the need to
clarify this point.</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<p>If Williamson is right, then relying on intuition as evidence makes
e.g. the question “What is knowledge?” impossible to be answered in a
different manner than the one that reduces it to the question of what we
happen to think about the knowledge. The best way to avoid such
consequence would be, thus, to give up on crediting intuition any
evidential role in philosophy. In a similar vein, Deutsch (2015) claims
that while intuition understood qua intuited content may very well be
evidence in philosophy, it is not so if intuition is understood qua
state of intuiting something.</p>
<p>Now, my goal in further parts of the paper is not to argue - in
general or in detail - against the Intuition Deniers’ claim against the
evidential role of intuition in philosophy. <span
class="math inline"><sup>8</sup></span> Instead, in the remaining parts
of the text, I am going to challenge the appropriateness of presenting
the aforementioned distinction as a sharp one, and propose a minimal
understanding of intuition that would suffice to maintain the claim that
intuition is, indeed, used as evidence in philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="intuition-as-justification">4. Intuition as justification</h2>
<p>Philosophers stressing the distinction between the intuited and the
intuiting tend to conceive of it as a sharp one. According to them,
intuition is either a particular state - what renders it epistemically
irrelevant (for the reason outlined in the previous section), or has a
propositional character - as (virtually) any other form of philosophical
evidence. On that view, the intuiting is epistemically disconnected from
the intuited - and vice versa, intuited content is something quite
separate from the state of intuiting it.</p>
<p>It is, however, quite a surprising way of thinking about evidence. As
a mostly theoretical enterprise, philosophy does in fact rely on
evidence of the propositional kind. Not every propositional content has,
however, an equal evidential weight. An important and not trivial aspect
of evidence in philosophy concerns the question of the justification for
accepting certain proposition: what makes particular propositional
content to be accepted as evidence. In the context of the use of
intuition, such as in thought experiments understood in a way explained
in the second section, very often the answer is that a given proposition
is accepted because it is intuitive. In other words, intuited content is
accepted because the fact that someone is intuiting it justifies her in
accepting that content.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>8</sup></span> Because of the scope of
the paper,not because I hold with Intuition Deniers’ view. The most
compelling arguments for why Intuition Deniers are in error can be found
in: Nado (2016, 2017), Climenhaga (2018), Chalmers (2014), Weinberg
(2014), and Devitt (2015).</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<p>Kamil Cekiera</p>
<p>This conjuncture is hardly unusual. It suffices to think about
multiple other kinds of propositional attitudes that can be interpreted
in a similarly dual fashion. When I say that I have a certain desire, I
can have in mind a particular mental state or propositional content of
that desire. If I have the desire to go to a football game, the
propositional content (as expressed e.g. by my utterance “I want to go
to a football match”) is justified by the mental state I currently have
(my state of willingness to go to a football game). Moreover, such
mental state also specifies the truth conditions of my utterance since
the truth-value of the sentence “I want to go to a football match” is
determined solely by my corresponding mental state.</p>
<p>Similarly, the state of intuiting something can be treated as a prima
facie justification for accepting the intuited content. Some
philosophers indeed suggested thinking about the evidential role of
intuition in philosophy in this way. For instance, Johnnie R. R.
Pedersen defines intuition as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">S</span> intuits that <span
class="math inline">P≡<sub>df</sub>P</span> is the content of a
spontaneously occurring mental state (that is, one not formed through
overt reasoning) that <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> finds
prima facie plausible. (Pedersen, 2015, p. 110)</p>
<p>The reason why prima facie provision is emphasized is that intuition
is treated as fallible. Someone may intuitively believe that <span
class="math inline">P</span> ,but faced with prevailing evidence to the
contrary, give up on believing that P. The state of intuition, thus,
provides a justification for an intuitive proposition, but only a
defeasible one.</p>
<p>The problem is, of course, that such definitions as Pedersen’s one
are in scarcity in philosophical papers. Regarding the first-order
philosophy, philosophers generally do not specify what exactly they have
in mind when they talk about intuition. Worse still: very often, no
overt intuition-talk is present in the texts and it is a matter of
(metaphilosophical) interpretation to indicate that intuition plays an
evidential role in a given paper.</p>
<p>Confronted with a particular philosophical text, we are by and large
left with certain explicitly expressed propositions that constitute
putative evidence for a given philosopher’s theory or claim. While that
much can be said in agreement with philosophers like Williamson or
Deutsch, it is undoubtedly a trivial observation. What is nontrivial is
the issue of the grounds we have for accepting a given proposition,
i.e. what justifies that proposition. Commonly philosophers easily come
up with a variety of justifications for the beliefs they hold. It is
important, however, to distinguish between (again) two senses of
justification. In one sense, justification can be understood as
something that makes certain proposition justified. In the other,
justification is a reason one presents to others in order to convince
them that certain proposition is justified. Borrowing terminology from
Pryor (2014), we can call the former justification-maker and the latter
justification-shower.</p>
<p>In many cases, justification-maker will be identical to
justification-shower. Justification-maker for the belief that my
armchair is comfortable is simply that I enjoy sitting on it.</p>
<p>Asked for a reason why I take my armchair to be a comfortable one, I
will answer in the same way, that is, justification-shower for that
belief will also be that I enjoy sitting on it. Sometimes, however, two
senses of justification will be clearly separate. If I am falsely
accused of committing a certain crime, justification-maker for the
belief that I am innocent is just the fact that I did not commit the
crime. However, while standing trial, that would not be enough to
justify my innocence. I would have to present some additional evidence
to convince the court that I did not commit the crime - that is, I would
have to present some justification-shower that differs from
justification-maker. <span class="math inline"><sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p>Even if philosophers are very keen on providing justification-showers
for their claims, there still is a question of justification-makers for
those claims. Why focusing solely on justification-showers, presented
usually in the form of arguments, does not suffice to evaluate a claim’s
correctness is nicely explained (though in a slightly different context)
by Jennifer Nado:</p>
<p>It may well be that philosophers standardly try to justify their
intuitively-held beliefs via argument. The trouble is that arguments -
even good arguments - are cheap. The fact that someone has come up with
a good argument for a claim doesn’t (more’s the pity) guarantee that the
claim is correct. As every philosopher knows, for any given
philosophical problem there tend to be good arguments for multiple
different solutions. Intelligent people can generally quite easily
produce convincing arguments in favor of whatever position they are
currently inclined to hold. Unfortunately, they rarely invest nearly as
much effort into attempts to produce arguments for the views they are
not currently inclined to hold. (Nado, 2016, p. 797)</p>
<p>If we agree with that much, what follows is that to assess
philosopher’s justifcation for a belief she holds, we need a broader
story about the grounds for accepting that belief. In other words, we
need to understand the etiology of a given belief: on the basis of what
one comes to accepting a certain intuitive proposition.</p>
<h3 id="the-source-of-evidence">5.The source of evidence</h3>
<p>So far, I have argued that even though it is the intuited
propositional content that (occasionally) is treated as evidence for a
particular philosophical theory or claim, the epistemic credence of such
evidence cannot be accurately assessed without paying sufficient
attention to the grounds one has for accepting the intuitive proposition
in question. The notion of grounds is, however, a bit obscure,
especially if we want to focus on the connection between the state of
intuiting something and the acceptance of the intuited propositional
content.</p>

<p>Intuition as a Source of Evidence in Philosophy: The Minimal View</p>
<p>Kamil Cekiera</p>
<p>The most natural - and somehow common - way to explicate that notion
and make it more vivid is to say that while the propositional content of
intuition is used as evidence, it is the state of intuiting something
that is the source of that evidence. From an epistemological point of
view, it is quite uncontroversial that certain mental states are sources
of evidence for particular propositions. Think of perception, for
example. If I want to claim that the table in front of me is not empty,
evidence for such a claim may consist of the proposition “There is a
laptop on the table”. Although that evidence is strictly propositional,
its source is a certain mental state: that of perceiving a computer on
the table. I might come up with some additional evidence for my claim,
but perception alone will suffice in most cases. At the same time, it is
defeasible evidence: I might be wrong, e.g. because of the hallucination
or because I did not realize from the distance that the laptop is in
fact on the shelf behind the table. But unless I am presented with
prevailing evidence to the contrary, I have prima facie evidence for my
claim, one that has purely “psychological” <span
class="math inline"><sup>10</sup></span> source.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is so with intuition as evidence. Although the actual
evidence (the intuited) is of propositional nature (as expressed by
philosophers in their texts), the source of that evidence is the state
of intuiting something. The propositional content is not, however,
independent from its source: in fact, accepting certain intuitive
propositions is justified by the state of intuiting it. In that sense,
the intuiting constitutes grounds for accepting the intuited. If all
that is correct, then even though there is indeed a content-state
ambiguity in the claim ‘intuition is used as evidence in philosophy’,
the two understandings of intuition are interconnected and cannot be
treated separately.</p>
<p>Now, if the source of evidence is significant for accepting its
deliverance, one may wonder whether or not some propositional content is
already accompanying the state of intuiting something. McGahhey and Van
Leeuwen (2018) argue that, contrary to the majority view, in the process
of intuiting something, there is no conscious propositional content
involved. According to them, intuitions (in a state sense) are more akin
to hunches or urgings, but are not formulated by any determined
proposition. Even though the authors do not explicitly refer to the
state-content ambiguity, their hypothesis fits nicely with the picture
sketched above. They provide both textual arguments concerning
particular philosophical thought experiments and a bulk of empirical
studies from psychology and cognitive science to support their claim.
For instance, McGahhey and Van Leeuwen observe that while the vast
majority of philosophers share Gettier intuition, there is hardly any
agreement on what an exact formulation is (that is,what is a
propositional content) of that very intuition. <span
class="math inline"><sup>11</sup></span> The fact that people share the
intuition but vary on its verbal expression suggests, according to them,
that intuition comes with no determined propositional content.</p>

<p>Kamil Cekiera</p>
<p>Their general idea can also be supported from other empirical
findings in cognitive psychology. For instance, Yaniv and Meyer (1987)
experimentally demonstrated that intuitions are often accompanied by the
“feeling of knowing” that cannot be easily verbalized - commonly
referred to as the ‘tip-of-the-tongue’ experience. Similarly, Dane and
Pratt (2007) indicate that while the process of intuiting is not
conscious, it is not so with its outcome (which the authors refer to as
‘intuitive judgment’). In their meta-analytic study of the various
empirical evidence from the field of psychology and social cognitive
neuroscience as regards the phenomenon of intuition, Hodgkinson,
Langan-Fox and Sadler-Smith (2008, 4) emphasize exactly that aspect of
the process of intuiting: “Intuiting is a complex set of interrelated
cognitive, affective and somatic processes, in which there is no
apparent intrusion of deliberate, rational thought”, adding that what
characterizes intuition in this sense is that it is often hard to
verbally express it, as it presents more like a hunch than a determined
proposition.</p>
<p>There are at least two upshots to be taken from those considerations.
Firstly, it seems that the state-content ambiguity of intuition is
well-supported both theoretically and empirically. And while these two
understandings of intuition are in fact diverse, they are the two sides
of the same coin. Secondly, the process of intuiting is partially an
empirical matter, that can be studied (and indeed is) by means of i.a.
psychology and cognitive science. The questions left for philosophers
are those: how does it bear on the epistemic status of intuition in
philosophy and how should philosophers understand intuition in their
relevant domain.</p>
<h2 id="intuition-in-philosophy-the-minimal-view">6. Intuition in
philosophy: The minimal view</h2>
<p>The previous considerations lead to the following picture of the
evidential role of intuition in philosophy. The claim that philosophers
use intuition as evidence relies on the ambiguous understanding of
“intuition”. On the first reading, intuition is a mental state that is
present e.g. when one reads a thought experiment. On the second,
intuition is just a propositional content of that state, as expressed
e.g. by the judgment on thought experiment (“in scenario <span
class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> ,it is not the case that <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em><sup>′′</sup></span> ). To avoid the
charge of psychologizing evidence,one needs to admit that it is the
latter that is used as evidence in philosophy. However, the etiology of
the proposition matters: one’s justification for accepting a given
proposition crucially hinges on the reason one has for that acceptance.
It is, thus, more accurate to say that while the propositional content
of intuition is used as evidence in philosophy, the source of such
evidence is the state of intuiting that content. What exactly the
process of forming a given proposition looks like is an empirical
matter, one that can be studied by means of e.g. psychology or cognitive
science. What is important for philosophers is how the intuitive
judgment is characterized and what its role is in philosophical
practice.</p>
<p>The question of the characteristics of intuitive judgment comes down
to the question of what distinguishes it from other types of judgments.
What is most often pointed to in this context is the distinctive feature
of immediacy or directness of intuition. As observed by Intuition as a
Source of Evidence in Philosophy: The Minimal View Kamil Cekiera Jenkins
(2014, p. 94), there are at least two ways we can think of that property
of intuitive judgments. The former concerns its non-inferentiality - the
fact that the judgment is not a product of any overt inference or
reasoning, and the second refers to its alleged obviousness or
spontaneity. While the latter is of a phenomenological matter, the
former may be dealt with either by psychology or epistemology. From the
psychological perspective, what is interesting is the actual process of
intuiting something - how it works, what it takes and what kind of
cognitive mechanisms are responsible for it. As I have already pointed
out, psychologists are indeed engaged in pursuing such studies. From the
epistemological point of view, however, what is important is the context
of the justification of judgments: whether or not they are inferentially
justified.</p>
<p>What is called for here is, of course, justification-maker in the
sense spelled out before. It does not matter, epistemically speaking, if
one can come up with a post hoc inferential justification for an already
accepted proposition. In particular, such justification can proceed
abductively, as an inference to the best explanation. What distinguishes
intuitive judgment, however,is that what makes it justified for a
subject is not based on any conscious inference. <span
class="math inline"><sup>12</sup></span> That justification is, at the
same time, a defeasible one: it gives one the disposition to accept some
proposition, but the stronger evidence to the contrary may overrule that
inclination.</p>
<p>All that leads to the minimal view of the evidential role of
intuition in philosophy. The claim that philosophers use intuition as
evidence should be read that philosophers use intuitive judgments as
evidence, and the source of that evidence is the state of intuiting
something, one that is psychological and can be studied through
empirical means. Even though such studies matter for the epistemic
status of given intuition, from the epistemological point of view, what
is important is that the outcome of the process of intuiting constitutes
a defeasible justification for accepting a particular proposition.</p>
<p>The most obvious advantage of accepting the minimal view is that it
provides a plausible response to the Intuition Deniers’ challenge
regarding the evidential role of intuition in philosophy. But there are,
in my opinion, more reasons to accept the minimal view and consider it a
viable alternative to the more prominent theories of intuition in
philosophy. Firstly, it squares well with our common conception of
intuition, yet is minimal enough to make room for multiple different
theoretically detailed accounts of intuition. Secondly, it makes
explicit how can subjectively experienced intuition be interpreted in
the third-person scientific language. To that respect, it is compatible
with empirical findings (particularly in Kamil Cekiera psychology)
which, in turn, may potentially bridge it with the concept of intuition
as used in empirical science. Nevertheless, the minimal view, as
sketchily presented in this paper, if turns out successful, would have
to be developed to fully achieve those further goals.</p>
<hr />
<!-- Footnote -->
<p><span class="math inline"><sup>12</sup></span> One can argue
that,regardless of the presence of explicit inference,one can have an
intuition that is inferred implicitly. This line of argument against the
non-inferential view on intuition is developed, for instance, by van
Roojen (2014) and Balcerak Jackson (2018). Although the space does not
allow to address that objection adequately, I will only emphasize that I
focus solely on conscious, explicit reasoning. As much as the hypothesis
of the presence of implicit, unconscious inference is an interesting and
open empirical question to be studied e.g. by psychologists, from the
epistemological point of view, it is the explicit inference (or lack
thereof) that matters.</p>
<!-- Footnote -->
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a far-reaching disagreement in philosophy as to the nature
of intuition and its evidential role in philosophical practice.
Regardless of how exactly one defines intuition, there is, however, a
basic distinction between two senses of intuition: one that focuses on
the state of intuiting something and the other that takes intuition to
be characterized by its intuited propositional content. Correspondingly,
there are quite different approaches to the studies on intuition. One is
empirical, as regards the process of intuiting something, and the other
epistemological, as with respect to the justification one has for
accepting certain proposition.</p>
<p>In the paper, I have proposed a minimal account of intuition and its
evidential role in philosophy, according to which intuitive judgments
with particular propositional content are treated as evidence, while the
state of intuiting that content is the source of such evidence.
Intuitive judgments may, in turn, be identified by their
non-inferentiality and dispositional character.</p>
<p>Even though the underlying process of accepting certain belief is
opaque from the first-person conscious perspective and is a proper
subject of empirical, psychological studies, it is tightly connected
with its outcome. In fact, the eventual assessment of the epistemic
credence of relying on particular intuitions may considerably hinge on
the reliability of the process. As much as the process of intuiting
something has no direct evidential role in philosophy, it would be
highly unwise for philosophers to ignore what light empirical science
sheds on the nature of intuition.</p>
