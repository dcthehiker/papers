A number of criteria for discriminating diagrammatic from sentential systems of representation by their manner of semantic interpretation have been proposed. Often some sort of spatial homomorphism between diagram and its referent is said to distinguish diagrammatic from sentential systems (e.g. Barwise &amp; Etchemendy 1990). Or the distinction is analysed in terms of Peirce's distinctions between symbol, icon and index (see Shin (forthcoming)). Shimojima (1999) has proposed that the sharing of 'nomic' constraints between representing and represented relations is what distinguishes diagrams. We have proposed that the fundamental distinction is between direct and indirect systems of representation, where indirect systems have an abstract syntax interposed between representation and represented entities (Stenning &amp; Inder 1994; Gurr, Lee &amp; Stenning 1999; Stenning &amp; Lemon (in press).</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The purpose of the present paper is to relate the distinction between directness and indirectness to the other criteria, and to further develop the approach through a comparison Peirce's Existential Graphs both with sentential logics and with diagrammatics ones. Peirce's system is a particularly interesting case because its semantics can be viewed as either direct or indirect according to the level of interpretation. The paper concludes with some remarks on the consequences of sentential vs. diagrammatic modalities for the conduct of proof.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>1 Introduction</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Several fields have recently identified understanding how diagrams communicate as an important goal: AI, computer science, education, human computer interaction, logic, philosophy, psychology . . . To understand how diagrams communicate requires an understanding of how they are assigned their meanings - their semantics - and in particular how their semantics is related to the far more intensively studied semantics of linguistic representations. Any theory of diagrammatic semantics must answer the prior question which representations are diagrammatic, and which sentential. In fact, an insightful answer to this second question is likely to go some way to explaining the nature(s) of diagrammatic (and linguistic) semantics. And insightful semantic theories are a necessary base for the empirical study of the cognitive properties of diagrams.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><hr><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><!-- Footnote --></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>M.

Haarslev (Eds.): Diagrams 2000, LNAI 1889, pp. 132-148, 2000.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><!-- Footnote --></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><hr><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="2" id="mark-1112a569-9707-4328-85de-58094ea5d5b0" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div>We have strong pre-theoretical intuitions about which representations are diagrammatic and which are linguistic. What these intuitions do not make clear is whether this is a discrete boundary, a smooth dimension, or some complex space structured by several dimensions which will allow that actual systems are composite. Here we will argue for the last option, and also that when we have a deep theory of what distinguishes diagrams and languages that it will show that our pre-theoretical intuitions were just misleading about some cases. Theory will reorganise intuitions, as so often happens.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>There are various recent accounts of what distinguishes the semantics of diagrammatic representation systems from the semantics of sentential languages. Spatial homomorphisms; type and token referentiality; Peirce's semiotic distinctions between symbols, icons, and indices; nomic vs stipulative constraints; and directness and indirectness of interpretation have all been proposed as dimensions for distinguishing diagrammatic from sentential representations. The first purpose of this paper is to clarify the relations between the various accounts of the semantic differences.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The second purpose is to elaborate the theory that directness vs. indirectness of interpretation is the fundamental distinguishing characteristic, by exploring two pairs of representation systems. Peirce's Existential Graphs (EGs) is an example graphical system equivalent to a well understood propositional system-propositional calculus (PC). Peirce's existential graphs are also compared with Euler's circles (ECs), a well understood, directly interpreted diagrammatic system.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>This pair of pairs of contrasting systems illustrate the importance of articulating a theory of 'diagrammaticity'. First it will be argued that EGs are diagrammatic only in a limited sense, and that this sense can be made precise in terms of directness and indirectness of interpretation, combined with a careful consideration of subtly shifting ontologies of interpretation.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The third purpose of the paper is to briefly explore consequences of direct and indirect semantics for the use of representations, especially in the justification of reasoning ie. in proof. The comparison of ECs, EGs and PC suggests a distinction in the ways that representations are used in reasoning between discursive as opposed to agglomerative modes. Only indirectly interpreted representations can be used discursively; and although indirectly interpreted representations can be used agglomeratively to some extent, there are distinct limits to such use. Directly interpreted representations have to be used agglomeratively and this has consequences for their use in proofs.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>2 Diagrammatic and Sentential Semantics Compared</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>2.1 Spatial Homomorphisms</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Barwise &amp; Etchemendy 1990 propose that spatial homomorphisms between diagrams and their referents is what distinguishes diagrammatic semantics from sentential semantics. Diagrams consist of of vocabularies of types of icon whose spatial arrangement on the plane of the diagram bears some spatial homomorphism to what is represented. The spatial relations between town icons on a veridical map, for example, bears a homomorphism to the spatial relations between the towns in the real world. This is not obviously true of the spatial relations between the names of the towns occurring in a written description of the spatial relations between the cities. This is the basis of Barwise and Etchemendy's theory of the difference between diagrammatic and sentential semantics.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="3" id="mark-f4e58e67-c9ad-4d12-bf23-70f0db69b4a8" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Etchemendy (personal communication) uses this framework to derive a common distinguishing characteristic he calls type- vs. token-referentiality. In type-referential systems (a paradigm case would be formal languages), repetition of a symbol of the same type (say of the term <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="63" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D465 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>x</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> or the name ’John’) determines sameness of reference by each occurrence of the symbol. Obviously there are complexities such as anaphora and ambiguity overlaid on natural languages, but their design is fundamentally type-referential. Diagrams, in contrast are token-referential. Sameness of reference is determined by identity of symbol token. If two tokens of the same type of symbol occur in a single diagram, they refer to distinct entities of the same type (e.g. two different towns on a map). Token referentiality is a particular case of spatial homomorphism: the identity of referents is represented by the spatial identity of symbol tokens: distinctness of referents by spatial distinctness of tokens. We shall see below that the type- token-referential distinction provides a particularly easily applied test of systems.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>2.2 Symbols, Icons and Indices</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Peirce not only made one of the original inventions of the first-order predicate calculus in both diagrammatic and sentential formalisms, but also defined three classes of signs: symbols,icons and indices <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="64" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . Symbols are conventionally related to their referents. Icons are related though their similarity to their referents. Indices are related to their referents by deixis - pointing. Peirce was quite clear that systems of representation could be composite. He described, for example, elements of sentential languages which were iconic and others which were indexical, even though the dominant mode of signification of sentential languages is symbolic. Diagrams, predominantly iconic, also contain symbolic elements such as words, often indexically related to their reference as labels by spatial deixis.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>This framework of kinds of signification has been used to distinguish diagrammatic from sentential semantics. Diagrams are held to be fundamentally iconic. Languages fundamentally symbolic. Both can have indexical features. Most obviously, languages have terms which are deictic-'this' and 'that' have common deictic uses. But diagrammatic representations also have indexical elements. The 'YOU ARE HERE', with accompanying arrow, on the town map displayed at the station, contains a piece of deictic language, but contains it as a deictic diagrammatic element which is dependent both on the spatial position of the sentence ('you are here'); the arrow; and the spatial position of the map.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><hr><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><!-- Footnote --></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>1 The relation between Peirce's term and modern uses of 'icon' such as Barwise and Etchemendy's is not transparent.

But deictic relations between representation and referent could also rely on homomorphisms between the two. It is notoriously difficult to make these distinctions work in detail. One pervasive problem is with specifying the similarity which supposedly underlies iconic representations. This problem interacts with vagueness about whether the similarity works to define the meaning of the sign, or merely helps us to remember the meaning of the sign. Etymology, for example, often leads to similarities between the meanings of components of a word, and the meanings of the word itself. These are similarities mediated through conventions, but that is only one problem. They are similarities which may help us remember the meanings of words, but they do not in general define what those meanings are. False etymologies rarely change the meanings of words. Similarly, many diagrammatic road signs have useful mnemonic relations to their referents (a particular curved pattern means a bridge; a pair of the same curves means a bumpy road surface) but are these mnemonic or semantic relations? One might go through life thinking that the common sign for female toilets is an icon for a long-life light bulb, or alternatively having no 'etymology' for the pattern at all, but without being the least unclear about the meaning of the sign, which is, surely, therefore, just as symbolic as the word 'ladies' sometimes also posted on the door.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The overall impression of Peirce's approach to distinguishing diagrams and languages is of insightful distinctions which are hard to weld into a systematic account of the semantics of representation systems. They illuminate a modern understanding of semantics, but they also predate it.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>2.3 Nomic and Stipulative Constraints</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Shimojima 1999 adopted the goal of synthesising parts of several accounts of the distinction between diagrammatic and linguistic representations in terms of nomic vs stipulative constraints <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="65" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c32"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . Nomic constraints are the result of natural laws: topological, geometrical or physical laws. Stipulative constraints are due to stipulative rules such as syntactic well-formedness conditions. The central idea is that diagrammatic representations have nomic constraints (as well as possibly stipulative ones), but linguistic representations have only stipulative constraints.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>A paradigmatic example of a nomic constraint is the topological properties of the closed curves that appear in many diagrammatic systems. Containment within a closed curve is a transitive relation.

One is in deciding what is a formal stipulated property, and what a natural topological property. Another is that the distinction between diagrams and languages needs more articulation than a single distinction can provide.

This seems to be a misunderstanding. Computational complexity theory explains the tractability of reasoning in terms of the size of the search space that a theorem prover has to operate over to find derivations for a class of results. This framework is as applicable to graphical theorem provers as to sentential ones, and explains the same inverse relation between expressiveness and tractability. The fact that the theorem provers for directly interpreted systems are generally integrated with the representation systems themselves should not obscure this point.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>2.4 Directness and Indirectness of Interpretation</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Stenning and collaborators have proposed elsewhere (Stenning, Inder &amp; Nielson 1995; Gurr, Lee &amp; Stenning 1998; Stenning &amp; Lemon (in press); Stenning (forthcoming)) that the fundamental distinction between diagrammatic and sentential semantics is between direct and indirect interpretation. Sentential languages are interpreted indirectly because an abstract syntax is interposed between representation and the referenced world. An abstract syntax is defined on a single spatial relation-concatenation. In written language, concatenation defines the 'scanning sequence' (e.g. left-to-right-top-to-bottom). In spoken language concatenation is a temporal relation. The interpretation is indirect because the significance of two elements being spatially (or temporally) concatenated cannot be assessed without knowing what abstract syntactic relation holds between them. So written text is interpreted spatially (different spatial arrangements of words have different meanings), but not directly (particular spatial arrangements such as immediate contiguity) do not have uniform meanings.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>This semantic property of languages is the fundamental characteristic which underlies all extant accounts of linguistic semantics. It is so fundamental that it is mentioned in the first definition of a language and thereafter taken for granted. The presence or absence of abstract syntax has the virtue of being well defined for sentential presentations of languages, though there are issues about how exactly to extend its application to two-dimensional languages, as we shall see. We will argue that many other important semantic properties flow from it. But as a criterion, it leads to a classification of actual representation systems which goes beneath the surface of what is 'obvious' about which things are diagrams and which language.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="6" id="mark-e256bef8-b040-4db1-a57d-e1a08b5a8920" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Some one dimensional systems which string together tokens of an alphabet are conventionally thought of as languages (finite state or regular languages) but have no abstract syntax. On our classification these systems have direct semantics (the stringing together of elements generally means that the denotata of two immediate neighbouring tokens occur in a particular temporal relation). Notice that here the interpretation of the spatial relation is uniform wherever it occurs, unlike concatenation in a language with abstract syntax. So on our classification these systems are semantically 'diagrammatic'. It is a moot point whether the constraints embodied in finite state languages are nomic or stipulative.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Conversely, there are representation systems conventionally thought of as graphical which our classification would treat as semantically close relatives of sentential languages, with the attendant indirect semantics. That is they have a semantics which interposes an abstract syntax on a two-dimensional version of a spatial concatenation relation between the representations and their interpretation. Examples are semantic networks and conceptual graphs, which derive from Peirce's existential graphs.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>2.5 The Criteria Related</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>How are these different criteria for distinguishing diagrammatic from sentential semantics related? Do they pick out the same classes of system? Can any sense be given to one of them being fundamental? Our main purpose here is to draw out some of the interelations between these ways of distinguishing diagrams from languages.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>With regard to homomorphisms, it is well known that sentential systems display homomorphisms between their sentences and the domains on which they are interpreted. This property is generally described as compositionality, and is most evident in the correspondence between syntactic and semantic rules in the definition of formal languages. In natural languages, compositionality is obscured, but is nevertheless generally assumed to hold at some fundamental level.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>If this homomorphism exists, then homomorphism is not a good distinguishing characteristic for diagrams? One might rescue homomorphisms as the differentia by claiming that the compositionality of sentential languages is not a spatial homomorphism. However, even this is problematical. Written languages are interpreted on the basis of a spatial relation-namely concatenation. Concatenation is a spatial relation which gives rise to a homomorphism, presumably a spatial homomorphism?</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The proposal to use directness of interpretation as a distinguishing characteristic can be viewed as a way of better defining what is to count as a spatial homomorphism. Direct interpretation precludes an abstract syntax; indirect semantics interposes a layer of abstract syntax between representation and interpretation. It is not that there is any lack of homomorphism in sentential languages, but it's recovery requires access to the syntactic interpretation of concatenation. Once the spatial relation of concatenation has played its part in defining a syntactic interpretation, it plays no further part in determining semantic interpretation.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="7" id="mark-e8d9e99e-b4a5-4895-8b67-4ed2c1c300d1" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Type- and token-referentiality are complexly related to directness and indirectness. Token-referentiality is a result of direct interpretation. The token icons of a directly interpreted diagram are placed on a spatial field (the paper) and their identity is an identity of position. Similarly, the identity of token words placed on a spatial field (the paper) is an identity of position. Direct interpretation means that some spatial relation between all icons must be interpreted as this identity relation. If any spatial relation between token icons other than identity/distinctness of tokens were chosen to represent identity/distinctness of their referents, the logical properties of the spatial relation would conflict with the logical properties of identity - the represented relation.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Only where there are abstract syntactic relations interposed between icons (here we usually call them words) can this conflict be avoided. The presence of an abstract syntax means that there has to be 'punctuation' of formulae into syntactic units (sentences) prior to interpretation because syntactic units are semantically discontinuous. This punctuation 'insulates' relations between terms that occur in different sentences and clauses. The relation of identity can be named as many times as is required. Identity then becomes just another named relation expressed by token words in the designated syntactic relation. Repetition of tokens of terms across syntactic units is then possible without generating spurious assertions of the non-identity of identicals.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The abstraction properties of diagrammatic and sentential systems discussed by Stenning &amp; Oberlander 1995 are also a consequence of these differences made by abstract syntax. Specificity of directly interpreted systems, and its attendant weakness of expressiveness of abstractions, arises from the fact that all the icons in the diagram's spatial field are automatically related to each other by all the interpreted spatial relations. The insulation of syntactic units one from another ensures that indirect systems can be indefinitely expressive.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The distinction of sentence and discourse levels which comes with abstract syntax has implications for the ways sentential systems are used in reasoning. Their use is necessarily discursive, whereas diagrammatic systems are used ag-glomeratively. This distinction is defined below in relation to Peirce's EGs. In the last section we will examine its implications for the justification of reasoning in proof.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>How do these properties relate to Peirce's iconic, symbolic and indexical ways of signifying? Modern uses of the term 'icon' in discussing diagrams is derived from computer icons and conflicts with Peirce's use. The semantic function of computer icons is most like that of words (the archetypal symbol). The shape and pattern of the symbol may or may not be successful at reminding us of its referent, but that mnemonic value is incidental to the semantic relation between icon and referent. Frequently, such icons consist at least in part of words, and their semantic function is no different whether they are words or patterns. The iconic (in Peirce's sense) aspect of computer icons is quite distinct, and resides in the arrangement of icons with respect to other diagrammatic elements. Archetypally, an icon's being inside a closed curve representing a directory, means that the file denoted by the icon is in the directory denoted by the curve. It is this correspondence of spatial relation in the diagram to the represented relation in the world that makes that part of the system iconic. It is the lack of any concatenation relation defining an abstract syntax that makes the relation direct.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="8" id="mark-dafb4506-e35a-4a04-80c9-199f49540bd9" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>So the computer icon's relation to its referent (the file) is in Peirce's terms, symbolic; its relation to the representation of the directory, and through it to the directory itself, is iconic. It is this relation which also represents a direct spatial homomorphism. Peirce was quite clear that syntactic relations in a language with an abstract syntax could be iconic - one example he cites is of algebraic relations representing transitivity iconically. He was aware that homomorphisms can work through an abstract syntax. But we should appreciate that this limits the usefulness of Peirce's terms for giving articulation to the distinction between diagrammatic and sentential systems.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>How is the distinction between nomic and stipulative constraints related to directness of interpretation? Indirect systems with their abstract syntax are assumed by Shimojima to have stipulative constraints: direct systems, nomic constraints. But nomic and stipulative are properties of the origins of constraints, and origins are complex matters that take us far beyond semantics. Besides, with indirect systems there are two levels of constraint-constraints on syntactic interpretation of concatenation; and constraints on semantic interpretation of syntax. One or both of these constraints might have natural or nomic origins. Which is to count? Comparing EGs and ECs will provide example quandries.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In summary, directness and indirectness of interpretation, with its attendant absence or presence of an abstract syntax defined on a concatenation relation, gives us a way of understanding the relations between the various proposals for criteria for distinguishing diagrammatic and linguistic representations. As we noted above, this theoretical distinction reveals considerable complexities in classifying real representation systems, and does not always yield the categorisation which pre-theoretical intuition suggests. The next section takes EGs as an illustration of applying the approach.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>3 Peirce's Existential Graphs</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Peirce's existential graphs (EGs) provide an illuminating case study for these various approaches to distinguishing the modes of semantic interpretation. Comparing Peirce's EGs with the equivalent sentential propositional calculus, and with other diagrammatic representations of fragments of logic clarifies the different accounts. What follows draws heavily on Shin's (1998) recent work which has done much to clarify the status of EGs by providing more perspicuous algorithms for translating between EGs and sentential calculi. We will restrict ourselves to the propositional calculus fragment of EGs (the alpha system), though the same kind of analysis is extensible to the beta system that corresponds to the predicate calculus.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>EGs consist of proposition symbols <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="66" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mrow><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c28"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c50"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2C"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-texatom space="2" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c51"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2C"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-texatom space="2" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c52"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-n" space="2"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2026"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c29"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-mrow></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="INNER"><mo data-mjx-texclass="OPEN">(</mo><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="normal">Q</mi></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="normal">R</mi></mrow><mo>…</mo></mrow><mo data-mjx-texclass="CLOSE">)</mo></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> inscribed on the ’sheet of assertion' (the paper), possibly enclosed within patterns of 'cuts' (closed curves).

Structurally, the most striking feature of EGs is that logical particles disappear. There are no connectives in the alpha graphs (shown here) and no quantifiers in the beta graphs. A simple way of thinking about the lack of connectives is to think of EGs as encoding a single-connective version of the sentential calculus.

These alternatives are often much more comprehensible than the ones derived from the particular outside-in reading scheme promoted by Peirce-his endoporeutic reading method. For example, the reading given above for the EG in Fig 1 is in negation normal form; but Peirce also defined a 'scroll' pattern which read the same sub-diagram (a cut enclosing X, itself enclosing a cut enclosing <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="85" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c59"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="normal">Y</mi></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> is a scroll) directly into equivalent conditional form <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="86" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mrow><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c28"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D443 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mo class="mjx-n" space="4"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2192"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-mi class="mjx-i" space="4"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D444 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c29"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-mrow></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="INNER"><mo data-mjx-texclass="OPEN">(</mo><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">→</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow><mo data-mjx-texclass="CLOSE">)</mo></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . Shin shows that crucial visual properties of EGs (even- and odd-enclosedness) can afford a variety of direct translation algorithms which can start by focusing on various different cuts in an EG. These visual properties also make the inference rules more intuitive. On this basis, she defines an algorithm for multiple equivalent readings of EGs-endoporeutic, negation normal form; conditional normal form etc. So EGs are not merely a calculus with one connective (Schaeffer stroke) but are somehow more radically different.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>EGs represent classes of connectiveful sentential readings, in classes of calculi differentiated by their connective vocabularies. This multiplicity offers new possibilities for reasoning. The fact that two sentences are translations of the same EG provides a demonstration that they are logically equivalent.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As well as the presence or absence of connectives, there are also processing differences between EGs and sentential calculi-differences in the ways that we usually envisage using EGs and sentential calculi.

Two dimensional EGs have no such fixed order of drawing, so the 2-D representations of EGs obliterate their production history. Logically, we could write sentences in different sequences (and within word-processors may sometimes we do so). In general our production of written sentences bears the heavy mark of the acoustic origins of language, and this carries through to our interpretation algorithms for them, which are left-to-right. But we must remember that Shin's multiple reading algorithms for EGs are as applicable to the EG sentential notation as to the graphs. Shin's multiple reading algorithms are a feature of translation from connectiveless to connectiveful calculi rather than of 2-D notation <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="87" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c33"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . The multiple sentential translations of EGs are like the multiple categorial grammar parses of unambiguous natural language sentences-all semantically equivalent (see e.g. Steedman 2000). Multiplicity arises in both cases through the erasure of some history of syntactic generation. We should be wary of assuming that multiple readability is a feature of diagrammatic representation.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="12" id="mark-7cd8ed53-b7c7-41ec-b7a1-a1bba8f11314" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Now to the discourse level. Sentential representation systems use sentences discursively. When a conclusion is derived from earlier sentences, it is rewritten on a new line of the proof.

At any time,the assumptions operative in an episode of reasoning are represented by a single EG ie. the whole of what is drawn on the sheet of assertion. If new assumptions are made, they are represented by being added to this single EG. Inferences are made by modifying this single EG - an example would be the erasure of a double cut surrounding a letter. Notice that this operation is equivalent to the rewriting of <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="89" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-cAC"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-cAC"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D44B TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">¬</mi><mi>X</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> as <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="90" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D44B TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>X</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . But therein lies the difference. Whereas derivation in the sentential system is represented by rewriting a new conclusion on a new line of a proof, the derivation in the EG system is represented by a modification of an existing EG - that is to say, not represented at all except in its result. The history of derivation is erased.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>EGs do not have to be used in this way in derivations. Shin uses EGs discursively, redrawing the modified diagram that results from inference rule application. A proof then consists of a sequence (or possibly a tree) of diagrams exactly analogous to the sequence or tree of sentences that make up a proof. It is an interesting question how generally the agglomerative mode could be used with EGs or with sentential systems? Instead of using separate representations of the several assumptions, we might conjoin them all into a single sentence; and instead of rewriting each result of inference rule application, a single sentence could be modified by erasures and additions - given the technology we have for erasing and inserting structure. But there is a real semantic problem with such uses. Proof history has to be maintained because the legitimacy of later inferences depends on it. Inference rules invoke their justifications by providing the line numbers of their input propositions. In agglomerative mode, there is no guarantee that the required structure still exists.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="91" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c33"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> Strictly speaking,the relation between graphical and sentential EGs is also not one-to-one because there are many ways of linearising an EG diagram.

For example, Euler diagrams are used by adding a new circle to the accumulating diagram each time a new premiss introduces a new predicate. Inferences are made by 'reading off' this agglomerated diagram. All the history of the reasoning that is relevant to future inferences is preserved in this diagram. But no inferences can be made without combining diagrams. Merely writing a sequence of diagrams of each premiss and conclusion gives no method of inference.

Directly interpreted diagrams, in contrast, require agglomerative use. How do these differences bear on directness of interpretation? In order to answer this question we need to go deeper into the processing of EGs, and in particular into differences between the one-dimensional and two-dimensional notations for EGs, and consequences for their processing.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Compare the EG in Figure 1 and its sentential equivalent repeated here: <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="93" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mrow><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c28"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D443 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mrow space="2"><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c28"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D443 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c29"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-mrow><mjx-mrow space="2"><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c28"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D445 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c29"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-mrow></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c29"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-mrow></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="INNER"><mo data-mjx-texclass="OPEN">(</mo><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi>P</mi><mrow data-mjx-texclass="INNER"><mo data-mjx-texclass="OPEN">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo data-mjx-texclass="CLOSE">)</mo></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="INNER"><mo data-mjx-texclass="OPEN">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo data-mjx-texclass="CLOSE">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo data-mjx-texclass="CLOSE">)</mo></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . Taking such a simple example formula reveals a striking correspondence. Drawing lines connecting the top of each left parenthesis to its corresponding right parenthesis and the same for the bottoms of each parenthesis, turns the string of symbols back into the EG diagram which it translates. Formally, the sentential language consists, as such languages do, of strings of symbols drawn from a vocabulary-P, R, (, ), . . - and, as always, some of these strings are well formed (the one just quoted as equivalent to the EG diagram) and some not (e.g. <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="94" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D443 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D445 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi>P</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> ) <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="95" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mrow><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c28"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D443 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c29"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-mrow></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="INNER"><mo data-mjx-texclass="OPEN">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo data-mjx-texclass="CLOSE">)</mo></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . This language,as all such languages,clearly has an abstract syntax. A phrase structure grammar would be easy to supply. No finite state grammar would be adequate because it could not capture the long distance dependencies between the left and right parentheses. The existence of ill-formed strings suggests stipulative constraints.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>What of the 2-D diagram EGs? What is their structure? They are composed of cuts and letters and the formal definition of 2-D EGs is simple enough, but it is made in terms of different elements than the sentential EGs. Cuts are not vocabulary members of a finite alphabet. And the constraints on legitimate arrangements of cuts and letters which form EGs are not statable in the usual grammatical formalisms. Cuts must not intersect each other. Letters must be wholly within or wholly outwith cuts. By simply putting back the 'ligatures' which connect the corresponding pairs of parentheses in the sentential version of EGs, the diagrams provide a concrete representation of their abstract syntax. The transitivity of containment in a closed curve provides a direct representation of the hierarchical syntactic relations in the EG's structure. But observe what the objects of this interpretation are. They are not the propositions which we normally think of as the semantic interpretations of sentences. They are, in fact the sentences and their constituents themselves - linguistic objects. EG diagrams represent directly the syntactic structures of formulae - their trees. EG sentences represent directly only strings of symbols-well-formed or not-and an abstract syntax has to be defined on these strings to sift the well-formed from the ill-formed, and to define structures for the well-formed.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="14" id="mark-03fd5c5d-a448-4bc6-8409-8a8048a87a82" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>So EG graphs directly represent sentences, but only indirectly represent the propositions that those sentences represent. EG sentences indirectly represent propositions, and indirectly represent what those propositions represent. So we can take EG graphs to be diagrams, but only if we understand that they are diagrams of sentences. Euler diagrams, in contrast, represent directly the propositions which they represent.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The topological relation of proper containment by closed curves gives rise to transitive inferences in both EGs and in ECs. Is this a nomic constraint or a stipulative constraint? How can Shimojima's framework do justice to the fact that graphical EGs are diagrams of sentences, but not diagrams of their meanings? It seems that a more structured theory is required, and the concepts of directness and indirectness can supply it.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>This more analytical view of levels of objects in distinguishing direct from indirect interpretations also answers the question whether EGs are type- or token-referential. If occurrences of the proposition letters P, Q, R ... in EG diagrams are taken to represent token occurrences of their proposition letters, then the EGs are token-referential. The leftmost 'P' in Figure 1 is a different thing than the rightmost 'P' in this ontology, and the two distinct occurrences of a 'P-icon' stand for two distinct occurrences of the proposition-just like two cities on a map. But at the level at which the two occurrences are understood as representing a single proposition, the EG is type-referential.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Studying Peirce's EG system clarifies some of the relations between alternative ways of distinguishing what is diagrammatic from what is sentential. Approaching the question through the concept of directness and indirectness of interpretation forces us to distinguish several distinct dimensions of difference between EG graphs and conventional sentential calculi, as well as between EG graphs and EG sentential notation: the presence or absence of connectives; the directness of interpretations at several levels; the erasure or not of history of single formula production; and the erasure or not of the history of proof.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>On the significance of the presence or absence of connectives, directness/indirectness tells us little. EGs provide both one-dimensional indirect and two dimensional direct notations for connectiveless calculi. Shin's multiple translations of EGs into connectiveful languages are a feature of EGs connectivelessness, not of what diagrammaticity they have. This seems an important dimension of representation which has been almost entirely ignored. The resulting idea of using parsing or translation mechanisms as inference mechanisms might be cognitively significant. But no evidence has been provided that specifically 2-D visual parsing mechanisms are any more useful for inference than 1-D mechanisms such as those evolved for natural language. It seems that presence or absence of connectives is probably an orthogonal dimension to that of diagrammatic or sentential representation. We should assume the dimensions are orthogonal at least until they are shown to interact.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="15" id="mark-7886dead-d303-4de2-8ad4-6e8fb8b16a21" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>On the second dimension, EG graphs provide directness of interpretation at the level of syntactic structures which EG sentences only provide at the level of strings of symbols. EG graphs' directness should make parsing tractable. However, neither system is directly interpreted at the level what we normally take to be semantics, and at this level we have no reason to expect further differences if ease of use. One theoretical gain from the example is realising that directness and indirectness can be construed at different levels of interpretation. At the level of some linguistic objects (e.g. strings), even sentences are directly interpreted.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The third and fourth dimensions have to do with the erasure of histories-syntactic or proof theoretic. Indirectly interpreted representations must generally be used discursively; directly interpreted systems agglomeratively. EGs seem to invite agglomerative use, even though it cannot be general, presumably because they are apparently diagrammatic. It is moot point whether for some tasks involving only the limited range of inferences where proof-history is not essential, EG graphs may have an advantage over sentential calculi which make agglomerative use unattractive.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Armed with this relation between directness/indirectness and agglomerative/discursive modes of use, I will finish with some necessarily brief remarks about the relation between discursive and agglomerative uses of representations in proof- the discourse of justification of reasoning. Any semantic account of di-agrammaticity ought to be able to account for the uses of diagrams and sentences in the business of proof.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Proof makes a 'story' out of a static situation-something sequential out of something simultaneous. A logical consequence (conclusion) of a set of premisses is a proposition already logically contained in the premisses. In order to gain perspective on this conjuring of dynamics from the static, it is helpful to compare conventional sentential proofs with proofs-without-words. In a proof-without-words (e.g. Nelsen 1993) a static diagram unaccompanied by words contains the justification of a theorem. Perhaps the best known are the several diagrammatic proofs of Pythagoras theorem in a single diagram. We can 'see' in this diagram containing a right triangle that 'the area of the square on the hypotenuse' is the same as 'the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides'. The diagrammatic system in the figure is directly interpreted and agglomeratively used.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The first obvious problem for proofs-without-words is the statement of the theorem. If we do not know what Pythagoras theorem is, we are unlikely to find it in this diagram. Even if we know that it is about triangles, there are still many triangles in the figure and no indication which is the topic of the theorem. To even state Pythogoras' theorem requires a representation system that can represent only part of the truths about right triangles. In particular, a representation system that can represent the square on the hypotenuse without representing the rest (especially the sum of squares on the other two sides); and <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="96" style="font-size: 122.8%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D463 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2E"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-mi class="mjx-i" space="2"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D463 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>v</mi><mo>.</mo><mi>v</mi></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> ; and can represent the equality of areas between these two entities.

If the consequences this theory for the inference rules which connect stages in a proof could be worked out in full, then it should tell us what the limits are of directly interpreted diagrams in the business of proof, for they are neither useless nor adequate. It is intriguing that an interaction between diagrams and language appears to have been what gave rise to the first invention of proof in Greek geometry (see Netz 1999).</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>4 Acknowledgements</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>This paper grew from a combination of reading a MS of Shin (forthcoming), and conversations with Patrick Scotto di Luzio about the requirements placed on representation systems by the goal of justifying reasoning-I am grateful to both for their stimulus.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>I would also like to thank three anonymous referees for their helpful and tolerant comments on a hasty earlier version of this paper.
