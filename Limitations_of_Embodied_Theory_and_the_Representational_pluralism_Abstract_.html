<p>Limitations of Embodied Theory and the Representational pluralism
Abstract</p>
<p>Since the mid to late 1970s, the traditional paradigm of cognitive
theory has been increasingly questioned in the fields of philosophy,
psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. With the
rise of embodied cognition, psychologists have begun to understand
conceptual representation in terms of embodiment, emphasizing the role
of the subject’s sensorimotor system and bodily experience in conceptual
representation. Although there is a large body of empirical research to
support the theory of embodied cognition, it still fails to provide a
reasonable account of the representation of abstract concepts. Recent
empirical studies have shown that concrete concepts and abstract
concepts involve different forms of conceptual representation. Thus, it
appears that the mechanism of concept representation is multiple.
Although the multiple representation hypothesis has shown more
plausibility and theoretical potential beyond the reach of embodied
theory, there are still many problems with the theory that need further
exploration.</p>

<p>Concepts are the basic elements of people’s cognitive abilities such
as dialogue, reasoning, and imagination. Traditional cognitive theory,
popular in the 1950s and 1960s, argued that the conceptual
representation of objects by subjects was achieved through amodal
abstract symbols. Abstract symbols represent conceptual content, which
has a one-to-one correspondence with linguistic concepts. For example,
the presence of the abstract symbol “hammer” in the brain allows people
to understand the meaning of the word “hammer” when they read it. This
view of conceptual representation is based on mind-body dualism, which
sees the cognitive process as a mere process of processing information
and computing abstract symbols, unrelated to the subject’s sensorimotor
system.</p>
<p>Since the mid to late 1970s, the traditional paradigm of cognitive
theory has been increasingly questioned in the fields of philosophy,
psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. With the
rise of embodied cognition, psychologists have begun to understand
conceptual representation in terms of embodiment, emphasizing the role
of the subject’s perceptual system and bodily experience in conceptual
representation. Although there is a large body of empirical research to
support the theory of embodied cognition, it still fails to provide a
reasonable account of the representation of abstract concepts. Recent
empirical studies have shown that concrete concepts and abstract
concepts involve different forms of conceptual representation. Thus, it
appears that the mechanisms of concept representation are multiple. In
this essay, I will attempt to introduce and analyze embodied cognitive
theories and show that embodied cognitive theories cannot provide an
accurate explanation of abstract conceptual representations. The
limitations of the embodied theory suggest that the subject’s conceptual
system may have multiple representational mechanisms. By sorting through
theoretical and experimental studies related to multiple
representations, I will argue for the plausibility of the multiple
representation hypothesis. Finally, I will point out the current
problems of multiple representation research and the directions that
future research can focus on.</p>

id="limitations-of-embodiment-theory-in-explaining-conceptual-representations-the-embodiment-hypothesis-of-conceptual-representation">Limitations
of Embodiment Theory in Explaining Conceptual Representations The
Embodiment Hypothesis of Conceptual Representation</h2>
<p>Embodied cognition is a new orientation in current cognitive
psychology research. Based on the Cartesian mind-body dualism,
traditional cognitivism sees human cognitive activity as the arithmetic
of abstract symbols. Human cognitive abilities such as thinking,
reasoning, and conceptual representation belong to the realm of the mind
which is separate from the subject’s sensorimotor experience. Cognitive
processes can take place through any appropriate medium, such as an
adapted physical device or a biological brain. However, influenced by
Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of perception, the mind-body dualism was
gradually questioned. On this basis, embodied cognition theory argues
that computation is not the only way of cognition. Human cognitive
activity is closely related to the interaction between the body and the
environment in which it is embedded. Because the brain is always the
brain in the body, the body is always the body in the environment. The
cognitive system is an organic wholeness consisting of the brain, the
body, and the environment.</p>
<p>Within the perspective of embodied cognition research, numerous
researchers have proposed hypotheses about the embodiment of conceptual
representations. These theories agree on the basic view of conceptual
representation: concepts are formed through the body’s perceptual
experiences of the world and can only be understood through these
perceptual experiences. A conceptual representation is not a separate
abstract symbol or mental representation, but a neural representation, a
perceptual, motor, and introspective experience that arises when a
subject experiences an object. Fundamentally, humans physically know the
world. Thus, the essence of conceptual representation is the storage of
perceptual experience.</p>
<p>The embodied hypothesis of conceptual representation is supported by
a large body of experimental evidence. Conceptual processing triggers
changes in bodily sensorimotor states. For example, when an individual
reads or judges a word, the cerebral cortex associated with the
conceptual content is rapidly activated (Goldberg, Perfetti, &amp;
Schneider, 2006), and the body’s motor state changes accordingly (Bub,
Masson, &amp; Cree, 2008). On the other hand, changes in the physical
properties of the body can also have an impact on conceptual processing.
These studies demonstrate that the subject’s sensorimotor system
provides the neural basis for conceptual processing and that conceptual
representations are rooted in the sensorimotor system of the subject’s
body. These studies demonstrate that the subject’s sensorimotor system
provides the neural basis for conceptual processing. These studies
demonstrate that the subject’s sensorimotor system provides the neural
basis for conceptual processing. Conceptual representations are rooted
in the sensorimotor system of the subject’s body.</p>
<p>Three Theories of the Embodied Cognition Hypothesis and Their
Limitations Within the perspective of embodied cognition research,
numerous researchers have proposed embodied theories about conceptual
representation. I will specifically analyze three main theories and
point out that each of these three embodied cognition theories has its
specific shortcomings. They are unable to provide a satisfactory
explanation for the problem of abstract conceptual representation.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-metaphor-theory">Cognitive Metaphor Theory</h2>
<p>Lakoff and Johnson (1980) proposed the Cognitive Metaphor Theory
based on the analysis and study of many metaphors. Metaphor is an
approach in which people use tangible, concrete, and simple source
domain concepts (e.g., space, temperature, action, etc.) to express and
understand invisible, abstract, and complex target domain concepts
(e.g., morality, psychological feelings, social relations, etc.), thus
enabling abstract thinking. (p. 252-253). In other words, Cognitive
Metaphor Theory suggests that people express and understand abstract
concepts through concrete concepts. The main ideas of the theory can be
summarized in the following three points.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is a process of metaphorical mapping from concrete
concepts to abstract concepts. Metaphorical mapping is the “scaffolding”
of the schema structure of concrete experience onto abstract categories
and relations. Through metaphorical mapping, people acquire new
knowledge and understanding. This scaffolding mechanism corresponds to
some of the most basic cognitive characteristics of humans. ( Williams,
Huang, &amp; Bargh, 2009)</p>
<p>Secondly, the process by which abstract concepts are scaffolded by
concrete concepts is not only linked at the level of words but also to
the level of mental representations. For an abstract concept that cannot
be perceived with bodily experience, one maps a concrete concept linked
to a sensorimotor system, thus constructing the intrinsic logical
structure of the abstract concept with the schema structure of the
concrete concept, and this perceptual experience associated with the
concrete concept is a necessary part of the representation of the
abstract concept. (Landau, Meier, &amp;Keefer, 2010).</p>
<p>Thirdly, in the process of understanding abstract concepts, the
subject has a perceptual experience. When people learn abstract concepts
or think abstractly, not only do they understand abstract concepts based
on concrete concepts, but the perceptual experiences associated with
concrete concepts are also activated. At this point, the subject will
process the abstract concept experientially. “No matter how complex an
abstract concept is, it necessarily becomes associated with a bodily
part. People’s experience is limited to what the body can experience and
conceptualize abstract concepts based on bodily experience.” (Lakoff
&amp; Johnson, 1999).</p>
<p>The basic assumptions of Cognitive Metaphor Theory are supported by
many experiments. However, although metaphors can be used to mediate the
connection between perceptual actions and abstract concepts, this does
not mean that abstract conceptual representations are based exclusively
on bodily experience. Cognitive Metaphor Theory emphasizes the use of
concrete conceptual structures associated with perceptual categories to
represent abstract conceptual structures, rather than the abstract
concepts themselves. Thus, the theory does not deny the existence of
independent representations. Subjects can process abstract categories
more figuratively through metaphorical mechanisms, but the relevant
sense perceptual representations do not cover the full meaning of an
abstract concept.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cognitive Metaphor Theory cannot answer the question of
the specific mechanisms of the metaphorical mapping process. Cognitive
Metaphor Theory only examines the cognitive impact of changes in a
single perceptual experience. People will use the same concrete concept
to construct multiple abstract concepts. For example, the concept of ‘up
and down’ is metaphorically mapped to several abstract concepts such as
‘status’, ‘power’, and ‘taste’. People also use several concrete
concepts to construct an abstract concept. For example, there is a
metaphorical mapping between the abstract concept of ‘morality’ and
several concrete concepts such as ‘pure-dirty’, ‘up-down’, and
‘light-dark’. These phenomena suggest that in constructing abstract
concepts, people do not simply use a single perceptual channel, but may
engage in multiple channels of information processing.</p>
<p>Finally, Cognitive Metaphor Theory suggests that metaphorical
mappings are unidirectional, i.e., the processing of abstract concepts
by perceptual experience is unidirectional. Some experiments support
this view (Casasanto &amp; Boroditsky, 2008): changes in spatial stimuli
only affect judgments of temporal distance in a unidirectional manner.
However, experiments demonstrating that metaphorical mappings are
bidirectional also exist. For example, temperature experience and social
interpersonal effect are mutually influential (Williams &amp; Bargh,
2008).</p>
<h2 id="perceptual-symbol-system-theory">Perceptual Symbol System
Theory</h2>
<p>In the early days of cognitive psychology, the propositional symbolic
theory was the dominant theory for explaining the representation of
knowledge. The theory considered propositions to be the material that
constitutes cognition, and that propositions are interconnected to form
propositional networks in the human brain. Is linguistic understanding a
manipulation of abstract symbols, or is it rooted in perception and
behavior? There is no agreement between different theories on this
question (Rolf, 2014).</p>
<p>Barsalou (1999) challenged propositional symbol theory by proposing
Perceptual Symbol System Theory based on Cognitive Metaphor Theory. The
theory challenges the non-modal cognitive theory by using perceptual
symbols to explain how behavior and cognition are realized in the brain
(Pezzulo &amp; Calvi, 2011).</p>
<p>Perceptual Symbol Systems Theory places particular emphasis on the
role of situational factors in conceptual representation. They argue
that the subject’s knowledge of an object is not abstract and completely
out of context but is acquired in a situational context. Thus, the
subject represents conceptual knowledge in a situated way. There is no
direct relationship between what the abstract concept refers to and the
subject’s perceptual system, but the situational experience associated
with the abstract concept, such as behavior, action, emotion,
introspective experience, etc., can be used as a perceptual
representation of the abstract concept, which is the embodiment of the
abstract conceptual representation (Barsalou, 2005; Prinz, 2005).
Namely, concrete concepts involve direct perceptual representations,
while abstract concepts involve indirect perceptual representations
based on situational experiences. The basic contents of the theory can
be summarized in the following five points.</p>
<p>Firstly, Perceptual symbols are the result of neural representations
in the sensory-motor areas of the brain, which are the materials that
constitute cognition. The brain processes things in the objective
environment typically situated and then internalizes them as perceptual
symbols.</p>
<p>Second, the transition from lower to higher cognition is made by
simulators in long-term memory. Simulators consist of perceptual symbols
and their frames, which are used by the subject to simulate the object
world when perceiving it, thus enabling the perception of the external
world.</p>
<p>Thirdly, people select perceptual symbols from external objects
through selective attention and store pictorial representations of
perceptual objects in long-term memory. Since attention selects only a
part of the external object, perceptual symbols represent only part of
the perceptual experience, but not the whole perceptual experience.</p>
<p>Fourthly, perceptual symbols are muti-modal and come from different
sensory channels (visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, etc.). There
are different types of cognition, and different types of cognition
require different simulations for their implementation.</p>
<p>Fifth, the relationship between external referents and perceptual
symbols has an important role in the simulation process. In perceiving
the world, the subject needs not only the participation of the object
but also the environment. The environment is processed in the simulation
system to form situated conceptualizations that assist the subject in
processing the object.</p>
<p>Perceptual Symbol Systems Theory has had a significant impact on a
wide range of disciplines, but it also faces many unresolved issues.</p>
<p>Firstly, not all abstract concepts are situated in a particular
context, for example, “therefore” “category”. It is difficult to
demonstrate how these abstract concepts are grounded in situated
experience. Situational information is also insufficient to represent
the true meaning of an abstract concept. Situated relevant perceptual
experiences may only be part of the abstract conceptual
representation.</p>
<p>Second, there is a considerable amount of experimental evidence for
the existence of perceptual symbols, but there is also a large body of
research demonstrating that propositional symbols are also present in
cognitive processes. So how do perceptual and propositional symbols
relate to each other? Do they exist at the same stage of processing? Do
the main types of representations differ between the different stages of
processing?</p>
<p>Finally, it is not clear how perceptual symbols are acquired.
Perceptual symbol theory suggests that people acquire concrete concepts
through early sensorimotor experiences. However, research has shown that
infants also use perceptual symbols in their cognitive processing. This
would imply that perceptual symbols do not come from early experience.
So, how do perceptual symbols get acquired? Are they acquired through
genetics, learning, or some other form of encoding? Simulating
Sensorimotor Metaphor Theory</p>
<p>Piaget (1962) has long regarded simulation as part of cognitive
development and as a necessary way of learning new actions and
knowledge. The most influential studies on mental simulation in recent
years are Meltzoff’s Theory-Theory and Goldman’s Simulation Theories
(Newen &amp; Schlicht, 2009). Theory-Theory (Melzoff, 1999) emphasizes
the causal relationship between simulation and mental understanding,
which means that simulation is a prerequisite for psychological
understanding. Goldman’s Simulation Theory (1992) suggests that people
understand the intentions, desires, emotions, attitudes, and beliefs of
others by using their mental mechanisms to imitate the mental activities
of others.</p>
<p>The discovery of mirror neurons provided the neurobiological basis
for embodied cognition and mental simulation theory. Subsequent fMRI and
TMS studies have revealed the existence of mirror neural mechanisms in
the cortex of the human brain. Based on empirical evidence from
neurobiology, as well as Cognitive Metaphor Theory and Perceptual Symbol
Theory, Slepian and Ambady (2014) proposed Simulating Sensorimotor
Metaphor Theory (SSM).</p>
<p>The SSM model adds mainly to the two previous theories as follows.
Firstly, there is a strong link between bodily sensory movement and
understanding and judging abstract concepts. Not only can the concrete
domain influence the abstract domain, but the abstract domain can also
influence the concrete domain. In other words, metaphorical mapping has
a two-way effect. Secondly, metaphors are acquired through later
learning, rather than through early experience. Thirdly, early
experience is not necessary for learning new metaphors. Even when
learning new embodied metaphors in the absence of early experience,
people can make associations between physical and mental states.</p>
<p>Many of the ideas about the theory still lack empirical support, and
three major issues need to be addressed.</p>
<p>First, do metaphors under different cultural contexts or knowledge
schema affect metaphorical outcomes? Casasanto (2008) found that there
are differences in the representation of the concept of time among
people who speak different languages. For example, Greeks would
metaphorically refer to time spacing as spatial capacity and would say
“time is full”. The British would metaphorically refer to time spacing
as spatial length and would say “time is long”.</p>
<p>Secondly, do metaphorical processes affect the sensorimotor system?
The metaphor “secrets are heavy” exists in a particular culture.
Experiments designed based on this metaphor have shown that asking the
participants of this culture to recall their secrets leads to a bias in
their judgment of the weight of objects. The specific mechanisms by
which metaphorical processes affect the sensorimotor system need to be
further investigated.</p>
<p>Thirdly, are there different ways in which metaphors are acquired?
Although some experiments have demonstrated that metaphors are acquired
through later learning, these experiments have been established under
artificial manipulation conditions and do not prove that all metaphors
are linked through learning. Perhaps different types of metaphor
correspond to different pathways of acquisition. Representational
pluralism: A New Assumption on Conceptual Representation Mechanism</p>
<p>The dilemma of embodied cognitive theory regarding abstract
conceptual representation suggests that perceptual-experiential
representations are not the only form of conceptual representation.
Subjects’ representations of conceptual knowledge may take plural forms.
This assumption removes the dichotomy between embodied representation
and non-modal symbolic representation. The presence of abstract symbolic
representations allows the human conceptual system to function better
and to meet different representational processing needs: concrete
concepts related to a particular bodily experience rely on perceptual
experiential representations. Abstract concepts that are not related to
bodily experience rely on abstract symbolic representations.</p>
<h2
id="empirical-studies-related-to-the-representational-pluralism">Empirical
studies related to the Representational pluralism</h2>
<p>Considered from a theoretical perspective, the Multiple
Representation Hypothesis could address the problem of abstract
conceptual representation. Some current empirical findings have also
found that different types of conceptual knowledge are stored
differently in the brain, which likely implies that concrete and
abstract concepts involve different representations. I will next present
evidence from different levels of empirical research to provide support
for the multiple representation hypothesis.</p>
<h2 id="evidence-from-pathology-studies">Evidence from Pathology
Studies</h2>
<p>Pathological studies have found that patients with aphasia suffer
from lexical dissociation in which the patient loses verbal processing
but not noun processing (Crepaldi et al., 2006). Further research has
found that when lexical imageability is added to the analysis, the
patient’s verbal aphasia is not present (Bird, Howard, &amp; Franklin,
2003). These cases suggest that these patients are unable to understand
and process verbs because their ability to visualize concrete words is
impaired.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, studies have also found a separation effect between
the processing of intuitively imaginable words (concrete concepts) and
non-intuitively imaginable words (abstract concepts) in some
brain-injured patients. For example, Marshall, Pring, Chiat, and Robson
(1996) reported a case of a patient with delayed aphasia. He was able to
use and understand abstract nouns with normal fluency but had difficulty
understanding concrete nouns and verbs, especially verbs with
significant perceptual features.</p>
<p>The lexical dissociation seen in brain-injured patients suggests that
concrete and abstract concepts have different representational
mechanisms and involve different brain areas.</p>
<h2 id="evidence-from-cognitive-neuroscience-research">Evidence from
Cognitive Neuroscience Research</h2>
<p>Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the processing of
concrete and abstract concepts activates different brain areas.
Rüschemeyer, Brass, and Friederici (2007) found that the premotor
cortex, motor cortex, and somatosensory cortex were more strongly
activated for the processing of concrete verbs than for abstract
verbs.</p>
<p>Sabsevitz, Medler, Seidenberg, and Binder (2005) found that the
processing of abstract nouns more strongly activated the left superior
temporal cortex and the left inferior prefrontal cortex, which are
associated with semantic processing, than concrete nouns. This
conclusion is consistent with the multiple representation hypothesis:
concrete concepts rely on perceptual experience representations and
abstract concepts rely on symbolic representations. Jirak, Menz,
Buccino, Borghi, and Binkofski (2010) also demonstrated that some brain
areas associated with physical actions (e.g., insula) were more strongly
activated when subjects heard sentences consisting of concrete actions
with concrete nouns. When subjects heard sentences consisting of
abstract actions and abstract nouns, brain areas associated with
language processing (e.g., the supramarginal gyrus) were more strongly
activated. In addition, Ghio and Tettamanti (2010) demonstrated that the
sensorimotor areas of the left hemisphere were more significantly
activated when subjects heard concrete sentences. When subjects heard
abstract sentences, brain areas such as the posterior pressure cortex
and cingulate cortex were more significantly activated.</p>
<p>Although the results obtained from different experiments are not
entirely consistent due to various factors, almost all studies show that
conceptual representations take different forms, one associated with
sensorimotor areas and the other with language areas.</p>
<p>In addition to brain imaging studies, ERP studies have demonstrated
that concrete concept processing is associated with greater wave
amplitude in the N400 Component of the brain (Huang, Lee, &amp;
Federmeier, 2010; Lee &amp; Federmeier, 2008).</p>
<p>Duñabeitia (2009), on the other hand, demonstrated that presenting
subjects with concrete concepts and abstract concepts triggered
different eye movement patterns when presented to subjects.</p>
<h2 id="evidence-from-behavioral-research">Evidence from Behavioral
Research</h2>
<p>Behavioral research has proven that subjects’ representations of
concrete and abstract concepts may involve different representational
systems. In an experiment by Scorolli et al. (2011), the researchers
created four different combinations of phrases using the same transitive
verb and noun (1. concrete verb + concrete noun; 2. concrete verb +
abstract noun; 3. abstract verb + concrete noun; 4. abstract verb +
abstract noun.) and present the phrases in the center of the screen.
Subjects were asked to judge as quickly as possible whether the
presented sentences had real meaning, and the judgments and response
durations were automatically recorded. The study found that, after
eliminating irrelevant factors, the response time for sentences
consisting of all concrete words or all abstract words was less than
that for sentences consisting of mixed words. The researchers suggest
that this is since concrete and abstract words activate different
processing systems. The concrete vocabulary activates the perceptual
representation system, while the abstract vocabulary activates the
semantic representation system. Phrases with different types of lexical
combinations trigger the involvement of different processing systems and
therefore require longer response times.</p>
<p>Borghi et al. (2011) simulated in an experiment the process of
individual</p>
<p>knowledge representation of novel concrete and abstract concepts. In
the first phase of the experiment, the researcher presented several 3D
pictures to the subjects. One part of the pictures represented concrete
concepts; the content of these pictures was novel shapes, each series of
which was shaped according to concrete, fixed rules, such as a fixed
color, number of prongs, etc. The other part of the pictures represents
abstract concepts; the content of these pictures reflects the abstract
dynamic relationships between objects. The dynamic relationships of each
series of pictures are also shaped according to a fixed order of
relationships, e.g., two objects are first separated, then brought
together in a horizontal position, and then separated at different
angles. Subjects were able to manipulate the <span
class="math inline">3D</span> graphics with the mouse while watching the
dynamic pattern of object relationship transitions. In a subsequent
test, the researcher presented the subjects with paired graphics or
pictures that reflected abstract relationships, and the subjects were
asked to determine whether the paired stimuli presented belonged to the
same category based on their learning in the previous phase. The second
phase of the experiment was the language learning phase. The researcher
presented the subjects with pictures of figures or dynamic
relationships, told them the names of the categories of these novel
figures or dynamic relationships, and explicitly explained to them the
rules for constructing these figures or dynamic relationships. After
this, the same test as in the first phase was completed.</p>
<p>It was found that in both tests, the subjects performed better on the
judgment of graphs than on the judgment of relations, indicating that
the learning of abstract concepts was more difficult. In addition, after
the second stage of language learning of abstract concepts, the
subjects’ judgment of relational stimuli (abstract concepts) was higher.
In other words, learning abstract concepts through language was more
effective.</p>
<p>The researcher concluded that the above results suggest that the</p>
<p>conceptualization of concrete concepts is mainly achieved through
perceptual</p>
<p>experience, while the conceptualization of abstract concepts is
mainly achieved</p>
<p>through language learning.</p>
<h2
id="theories-related-to-the-multiple-representation-hypothesis">Theories
related to the Multiple Representation Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Abstract and concrete concepts are fundamentally different in their
conceptual nature, and a single representational mechanism cannot meet
the needs of conceptual representation. Evidence from pathology,
cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral research all suggest that
different representational mechanisms exist in the human conceptual
system.</p>
<p>In theoretical research, hypotheses related to the multiple
representation mechanisms can be traced back to the Dual Coding Theory
(Paivio, 1991). This theory suggests that there is a language-based
representation system and an image-based representation system in the
human conceptual cognitive system. These two representational mechanisms
function according to different needs. For figurative concepts,
perceptual and linguistic coding are jointly involved in conceptual
representation. For concepts that are not figurative, only linguistic
coding is involved in conceptual representation.</p>
<p>The Words As Tools (WAT) hypothesis (Borghi &amp; Cimatti, 2010)
suggests that knowledge representation of concrete concepts can be
acquired through perceptual experience, whereas knowledge representation
of abstract concepts requires the involvement of linguistic functions.
Andrew, Vigliocco, and Vinson (2009) also argue that conceptual
representation involves two forms. One is experiential, which relates to
basic perceptual experience, and the other is distributional, which
relates to abstract symbolic processing.</p>
<p>In addition, some proponents of embodied conceptual representations
have revised their theories. For example, Barsalou (2008) proposed the
Language And Situated Simulation (LASS) theory, which argues that the
human conceptual system has a flexible dual processing mechanism. Among
them, the Situated Simulation processing mechanism associated with
perceptual experience is the basic form of conceptual representation.
The Symbol Interdependency Theory (Louwerse, 2010) presents a similar
argument in favor of multiple representations.</p>
<h2 id="theory-and-research-outlook">Theory and Research outlook</h2>
<p>The dilemma of the embodied cognition hypothesis in explaining the
abstract conceptual representation suggests that there is not just a
single mechanism of perceptual representation in the human conceptual
system. The dissociation effect between the processing of concrete and
abstract concepts suggests that there are different representational
mechanisms in the human brain. Current empirical and theoretical
research on multiple representation mechanisms is not yet mature enough.
In future research, we can make further explorations on the following
issues.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the presence of abstract symbolic representations, what is the
relationship between perceptual and symbolic processing mechanisms in
conceptual representations? Research on apraxia suggests that abstract
symbolic processing mechanisms are present in concrete conceptual
representations. The processing of concepts does not always require the
involvement of perceptual experience (Negri et al., 2007). When
presented with a hammer, a person with apraxia is unable to recall and
demonstrate the action of wielding or striking the hammer, or to
describe its use, but can point out that the tool is a hammer and recall
that the object associated with it is a nail. This suggests that with
the loss of the sensorimotor experience about the thing, the individual
retains a concept of the thing. In this case, people are conceptually
representing objects in terms of abstract symbols. Thus, abstract
symbols are also involved in the process of representing concrete
concepts. Furthermore, studies on metaphor show that perceptual
experience is also involved in the representation of abstract concepts.
This suggests that there are multiple representation mechanisms involved
in the representation of both concrete and abstract concepts, but that
different representational mechanisms occupy different positions in
different situations. So how do these two mechanisms relate to each
other in the process of conceptualization?</li>
</ol>
<p>One possibility is that the two mechanisms are completely independent
in the representation of knowledge because they have different neural
and physiological bases and are at different stages in evolution (the
symbolic mechanism is at a more advanced stage). Another possibility is
that there is a complex interaction between the abstract symbols that
represent conceptual knowledge and perceptual experience. Perhaps
abstract symbolic information and perceptual information are just
different levels of conceptual representation, and the two have a
superior-subordinate relationship. It has been shown that the
information provided by semantics is sufficient to help individuals with
some of the simpler conceptual understanding and processing tasks. It is
only when individuals need to make a complete understanding of certain
concepts that the conceptual processing processes associated with
perception are initiated (Connell and Lynott, 2011). This effect
suggests the possibility that abstract symbols represent the essential
meaning of concepts, while perceptual movements enrich the content of
conceptual representations (Mahon and Caramazza 2008).</p>
<p>The above hypotheses are not yet supported by sufficient empirical
evidence. Therefore, future research needs to explore the relationship
between various representational mechanisms to construct more complex
and detailed models of conceptual representation. Clarifying the
necessity of perceptual and symbolic representations for conceptual
meaning and specifying the status and role of different representations
in the conceptualization process will be an important direction for
future research.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The existence forms of abstract symbols is also a highly
controversial issue. Abstract symbolic representation is related to
language, and many multiple representation theories also involve
linguistic factors. So, what exactly is the relationship between
language and the symbols that represent meaning? Barsalou’s Language And
Situated Simulation Theory (LASS) states that subjects can represent
conceptual knowledge through linguistic forms such as word
frequency,</li>
</ol>
<p>word order, semantic networks, and lexical associations, but that
independent language itself does not have any meaning. This view
effectively denies the existence of abstract symbols. However, the
traditional theory of non-modal symbolic representation holds that
subjects can form an abstract, symbolic knowledge of things. Language is
a bridge between meaningful symbols and objective things, which is
“symbols of symbols”. If this hypothesis is valid, then we need to
answer a series of more complex questions, such as where do abstract
symbols come from? How are abstract symbolic representations stored? How
do abstract symbols relate to language? There is also the view that
language itself is an abstract symbol that represents meaning.
Initially, language was only an external, object-referencing symbol. As
the genealogy evolved and the individual developed, people gradually
acquired unique higher cognitive abilities such as abstract thinking,
reasoning, and imagination, and were able to construct further abstract
and complex conceptual systems based on simple concrete concepts. In
this process, external, symbolic, and formal language is gradually
internalized into symbols that represent meaning (Dove, 2011). 40
Although this view addresses the question of what abstract symbols are,
it is too macro and abstract, lacks clarity in theoretical detail, and
still lacks an explanation for many concrete issues.</p>
<p>Therefore, research into the form of existence, evolutionary
processes, and physiological basis of abstract symbols will be another
focus of future research.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Each of the three main embodied cognition theories offers its
explanatory solution to the problem of abstract conceptual
representation, but each has its shortcomings, so embodied cognitive
theories cannot provide satisfactory answers to abstract conceptual
representation.</p>
<p>Where embodied theories fail, empirical evidence from pathology,
neurobiology, and behavioral research has shown us the great potential
of the multiple representation hypothesis. Exploring the relationships
between different representational mechanisms and constructing more
nuanced representational models will be the focus of future
research.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to point out that since many studies of
multiple representations are concerned with semantic understanding,
perhaps embodied cognition theory and the multiple representation
hypothesis could try to cooperate and draw on each other’s theoretical
ideas to open a space for ‘embodied semantic understanding’. In the
Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty (1962) points out that speech
is ultimately a bodily gesture, a construct of the bodily subject.
Therefore, semantic understanding takes place in the subject’s body, and
the subject’s experience is involved in the process of semantic
understanding, making the meanings derived from semantic understanding
more meaningful for the subject. Based on Merleau-Ponty’s philosophical
resources, embodied cognition may truly move beyond the idea of
mind-body dualism, rather than merely reducing traditional cognitive
theories to the bodily level.</p>
