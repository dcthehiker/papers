<p>Philosophers debate about which logical system, if any, is the One
True Logic. This involves a disagreement concerning the sufﬁcient
conditions that may single out the correct logic among various
candidates. This paper discusses whether there are neces- sary
conditions for the correct logic; that is, I discuss whether there are
features such that if a logic is correct, then it has those features,
although having them might not be sufﬁcient to single out the correct
logic. Traditional rationalist arguments suggest that the necessary
conditions of thought are necessary and sufﬁcient conditions singling
out the correct logical and mathematical theories. In the contemporary
debate, Chalmers advocates a view along this line. Jago, analogously,
suggests that the necessary condi- tions for thought—or, as he calls
them, our basic epistemic expectations—single out a family of logical
and mathematical theories. Warren and Williamson, on the other hand,
argue that there are no necessary conditions of thought. I argue that
there are necessary conditions for thought, and these are necessary but
not sufﬁcient conditions to be the correct logic; indeed, these are
features that all logics—correct or incor- rect—share. No view we can
understand is ruled out by the necessary conditions for thought, but we
cannot understand quite any view. Human linguistic and conceptual
abilities are genetically constrained, and these constraints are our
best guide to the boundaries of logic. Arguing for this, I tackle two
dogmas of modern rationalism: namely, the view that the biological
constraints of human cognition have no bearing on the boundaries of the
epistemic space, and the view that the boundaries of thought coincide
with the boundaries of language.</p>

# 1 Introduction</p>
<p>Philosophers often disagree about logic. Russell ( 2018 ) argues that
conjunction intro- duction fails in some cases and Haze ( 2022 )
disagrees. Priest ( 1987 ) argues that there are true contradictions and
Williamson ( 2017 ) disagrees. McGee ( 1985 ) and Mandelk- ern ( 2020 )
argue that modus ponens fails in some cases and Bledin ( 2015 )
disagrees. Examples can be easily multiplied.</p>
<p>To think about this, it is natural to invoke the notion of epistemic
scenarios (Chalmers, 2011 ; Jago, 2009 ). Various views about logic
partition, or divide, the space of epistemic possibilities; they
separate scenarios in which the view is true from those that are not
compatible with it, or neutral. The trouble is that if the epistemic
space is a logical space, then in a sense disagreement about logic is
impossible, because logical truths are true in every logically possible
world.</p>
<p>Chalmers argues that the epistemic space of ideal agents is a logical
space; and therefore, ideal agents never disagree about logic.
Considering scenarios in which certain inference rules fail might be
useful “to making sense of the epistemic states of extremely non-ideal
thinkers” but a more useful notion of epistemic space has to capture
some sort of “rational must” (Chalmers, 2011 , p. 7). Chalmers remains
neutral as to exactly what inference rules are undeniable for ideal
thinkers, but he suggests that conjunction introduction might be one of
them. The trouble is that Russell ( 2018 ) offered counterexamples to
conjunction introduction. Therefore, in Chalmers’s view, she is likely
making a mistake due to her limited cognitive capacities (Chalmers, 2004
, pp. 207–210). Conversely, if Russell is not making any such mistake,
then Haze ( 2022 ) is. This seems problematic, at least prima facie.
Neither Russell nor Haze seem to be acting irrationally. Indeed, as
Williamson ( 2007 ) emphasised, experts are unlikely to act irrationally
when arguing for their views (p. 94), and in general, we might want to
allow for rational disagreement about logic, at least prima facie.</p>
<p>Chalmers might respond that, while disagreement between Russell and
Haze involves no gross irrationality, it involves some subtle confusion.
Indeed, Chalmers could argue that all disagreement about logic involves
some subtle confusion and that the work of philosophers debating about
logic consists of eliminating some sub- tle—and perhaps very difﬁcult to
detect—confusion. Jago ( 2009 ) protests that this view is too
restrictive, and he suggests a form of rationalism in which there can be
rational disagreement about logic.Inparticular,he suggests amending
Chalmers’sview by replacing possible worlds with Priest’s ( 2005a ) open
worlds. He agrees, however, that the epistemic space has to capture a
rational must (Jago, 2009 , p. 410). There can be disagreement about
logic in Jago’s epistemic space, but no scenario should fall short of
our basic epistemic expectations. For instance, no rational agent should
endorse an explicit contradiction or deny that 0 is 0 and not 1. The
trouble is, again, that some philosophers endorse explicit
contradictions and deny that 0 is 0 and not</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Priest ( 1987 ) argues that the Russell set is and is not a member
of itself, and Field</li>
</ol>
<p>( 1980 ) argues that all mathematical sentences are false. It seems
problematic, at least prima facie, to say that they are falling short of
our basic epistemic expectations; these works display a level of
sophistication that meets our highest epistemic standards.<br />
Given these difﬁculties, one might reject the idea that the epistemic
space has boundaries. Williamson ( 2007 ) and Warren ( 2020 ), despite
disagreeing on several issues, concur on this point. Williamson holds
that any view about logic can, at least in principle, be rationally
defended, although only one correct logic will eventually emerge thanks
to general scientiﬁc enquiry. Warren holds that the scenarios accessible
to speakers of a given language are constrained by meaning-determining
inference rules of that language;but there is no constraint as to what
sort of language a community mightadopt.These positions remove the d if
cul ties above,but they do so at a great cost. Rationalist arguments
dating back to Kant and before suggest that if it were possible to
determine the conditions of possibility of knowledge, this could provide
a wealth of information about logic and mathematics; that is, there is
some bridge principle connecting the boundaries of thought withthelaws
of logic and ma thematic(Chalmers, 2002 ). If there are no conditions of
possibility of knowledge—if the epistemic space has no boundaries—then
these arguments are a non-starter. I argue that this is an overreaction:
our conceptual toolbox has some constraints, although not the
constraints that Chalmers and Jago have in mind.</p>
<p>Williamson and Warren are not rationalists themselves. Thus, they do
not regard undermining traditional rationalist arguments as a limit of
their view. To argue that our conceptual toolbox has some constraints, I
need to provide evidence that non- rationalists might be willing to
accept from their viewpoint. My suggestion is that to assess whether our
conceptual toolbox has constraints, we should consider exper- imental
evidence. This is why I call mine an experiment-driven rationalism .
Human languages can develop in a myriad of different ways, but there
seem to be some genetic constraints to human language development. FOXP2
is the ﬁrst gene that was linked to language; it underwent a strong
positive selection in the human lineage only, and people with mutations
to it encounter disabling difﬁculties in speaking and under- standing
speech (Enard et al., 2002 ; Liégois et al., 2003 ). This, I argue ,
undermines the claim that there is no constraint to what sort of
language, and logic, a human com- munity might adopt. FOXP2 seems to
have a pivotal role in shaping human linguistic behaviour and
dispositions; thus, it seems, our linguistic toolbox has some
constraints.</p>
<p>One might protest that a true rationalist should focus on the
conceptual constraints of ideal agents since features of the human DNA
at best are evidence for our contingent cognitive limitations. Indeed,
one might insist that this matter should not or cannot be studied
empirically; to study the epistemic space, one must focus on the
conditions of possibility of language itself. I call these the
experimental intractability dogma and the language ﬁrst dogma . I argue
against these and propose a rationalist view that can do without
them.</p>
<p>My position is similar to Maddy’s ( 2007 ). Indeed, she might agree
with me in rejecting the dogmas. However, she agrees with Chalmers and
Jago that the boundaries of the human epistemic space—or “rudimentary
logic”—rule out some conceivable views, including, for instance, the
view that there are true contradictions (Maddy, 2007 , pp. 282–298). I
hold that no conceivable view falls beyond the boundaries of the
epistemic space, although the human epistemic space is not boundaryless,
because there are limits to what humans can conceive. As a result of
this, the boundaries of the epistemic space cannot be characterized in
terms of logical principles falling beyond the boundaries. We cannot
formulate the principles of an inconceivable logical system, because if
we could formulate them, it would not be inconceivable. What lies beyond
the boundaries of the epistemic space, thus falling short of the
necessary conditions for the correct logic, is beyond our grasp.<br />
This paper is not concerned with discussing the metaphysical nature of
the laws of logic. That is, unlike Hanna ( 2006 ) and Leech ( 2015 ), I
am not arguing that the correct laws of logic are constituted, entirely
or in part, by constraints upon rationality. The focus is rather
epistemological. I discuss whether the boundaries of our conceptual
toolbox can give us information about the necessary conditions for the
correct logic, regardless of what metaphysical view about logic is being
presupposed in the back- ground. Positions in the metaphysics and
epistemology of logic can, at least to some extent, be evaluated
separately (Martin &amp; Hjortland, 2022 ). I consider a variety of
metaphysical approaches, including Warren’s ( 2020 ) view that the laws
of logic are implicit linguistic conventions and Williamson’s ( 2013 )
view that the laws of the cor- rect logic are the most general features
of the world. In each case, I argue, the dogmas of rationalism do not
stand up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>The rest of this paper has the following structure. In Sect. 2 I make
some prelim- inary remarks concerning the nature of disagreement about
inference rules and the justiﬁcation of deduction. In Sect. 3 , I
discuss three often-invoked reasons to accept the experimental
intractability dogma. In Sect. 4 , I discuss the language ﬁrst dogma and
I point out one particularly noteworthy constraint that the human brain
structure seems to impose on our conceptual toolbox; this is what
Dehaene ( 2011 ) and Everett ( 2017 ) call the number sense. In Sect. 5
, I brieﬂy outline a rationalism without the dogmas, drawing my
conclusions.</p>
<h1 id="what-achilles-said-to-the-tortoise">2 What Achilles said to the
tortoise</h1>
<p>Carroll ( 1895 ) suggests that a certain approach to the epistemology
of logic leads to an inﬁnite regress. In Carroll’s dialogue, the
tortoise asks Achilles to consider a classically valid argument in which
conclusion Z follows from premises A and B.<br />
Then, the tortoise challenges Achilles to persuade her that one must
accept <span class="math inline"><em>Z</em></span> if one accepts A and
B. This, says Achilles, amounts to forcing her to accept an additional
premise (C) “if A and B are true, Z must be true” (p.279). The tortoise
readily accepts C but asks for a proof that one must accept <span
class="math inline"><em>Z</em></span> if one accepts A, B, and C.
Achilles suggests an additional premise D, which leads to an inﬁnite
regress.</p>
<p>This dialogue contains two crucial ambiguities. First, Carroll is
confusing rule circularity and premise circularity. A premise-circular
argument is an argument whose conclusion is also a premise. A
rule-circular argument proves that a rule is valid by employing the rule
itself. In the dialogue, Achilles adds additional premises stating the
validity of the argument. This is incorrect; the inference rules used in
an argument are not additional premises. Therefore, an attempt to give a
justiﬁcation of logic need not give rise to premise circularity in the
way Carroll suggests.</p>
<p>Arguments proving the validity of inference rules are indeed
rule-circular. And this raises questions about their epistemic worth.
Philosophers employing rule-circular arguments tend to argue that
although these arguments are not persuasive, they can be explanatory
(Dummett, 1973 ; Warren, 2020 ). A persuasive argument could persuade a
reader who is not willing to accept the conclusion from the outset. An
explanatory argument, on the other hand, explains why the conclusion is
true to a reader who is willing to accept it from the outset. Rule
circular arguments can never be persuasive but—say Dummett and
Warren—they can be explanatory.</p>
<p>I wish neither to accept nor deny this but only notice that insofar
as we are interested in disagreement about logic, we should focus on
persuasive arguments. Philosophers defending their views about logic
attempt to persuade their readers. McGee ( 1985 ), for instance, does
not take for granted that modus ponens is invalid; on the contrary, he
attempts to persuade us. Carroll does confuse rule circularity and
premise circularity, but in the context of his dialogue, the former is
as problematic as the latter. Indeed, the tortoise expresses scepticism
about classical validity, rather than asking for an explanation.</p>
<p>The second ambiguity in Carroll’s dialogue involves pieces of
reasoning and for- mal arguments. A formal argument —for the purposes of
this paper—is an argument employing a proof system in which it is
effectively decidable whether a given array of formulas is a
well-constructed derivation according to the rules of the proof system,
in a language in which syntactic properties and the interpretations of
sentences are also effectively decidable. A piece of reasoning is an
argument that may not employ explicitly deﬁned inference rules in a
language whose syntactic properties and inter- pretations may not be
explicitly deﬁned. In this characterization, all formal arguments
represent pieces of reasoning, but not all pieces of reasoning are
represented by some formal argument. Now, in the dialogue, the tortoise
challenges Achilles to prove that an argument is valid. This could
either be a challenge to provide a formal argument to the effect that
the argument is valid, or a challenge to give a piece of reasoning for
reaching the same conclusion.<br />
A formal argument concluding that a rule sanctioned by its proof system
is valid is clearly rule-circular. A piece of reasoning to the effect
that a given formal argument is valid may not be rule-circular. Loosely
speaking, rules governing our reasoning may serve as a meta-theory to
discuss about logic. Lately, one type of reasoning is often invoked in
connection to logical theory choice: abduction (Bueno &amp; Colyvan,
2004 ; Goodman, 1955 ; Priest, 2005b ; Russell, 2015 ; Williamson, 2017
).</p>
<p>I do not discuss the merit of abduction here. It is possible that in
some cases a straightforward application of abductive reasoning
considering speciﬁc theoretical virtues could be problematic (Woods,
2019 ). Furthermore, abduction is not the only type of reasoning that
philosophers use as they discuss logic. Russell ( 2018 ), for instance,
uses what we may label ‘reasoning by example’ arguing that conjunction
introduction is not valid by presenting a case in which purportedly it
fails. All I am noticing here is that philosophers advocating views
about logic tend to reason informally about deduction, rather than
giving formal arguments. Williamson ( 2017 ), for instance, does not
give formal arguments using a classical proof system to show that
classical logic should be preferred. Rather, he formulates pieces of
reasoning about deduction that his opponent, say a paraconsistent
logician, could be willing to accept. This should be quite
uncontroversial: in the philosophy of logic formal arguments are—at
least indirectly—an object of inquiry, and accordingly, they are rarely
used without qualiﬁcations.</p>
<p>The distinction between reasoning and formal arguments may seem to
dissolve Carroll’s challenge, but in fact, the problem arises again.
This is most evident if one thinks that logic is a methodological
discipline (Sagi, 2021 ), but it applies quite gen- erally to anyone who
thinks that there is a connection between the principles of logic and
epistemic norms of reasoning. If logic has a bearing, however indirect,
on how we should reason, then philosophers of logic are reasoning, at
least indirectly, about how we should reason. More generally, having
distinguished formal arguments and reasoning, the tortoise may still ask
to justify the pieces of reasoning that Achilles employs.<br />
The default rationalist solution for this conundrum is that ultimately
the justiﬁ- cation of reasoning is non-inferential. As they reason about
reasoning, Achilles and the tortoise must ﬁnd some pieces of reasoning
that they are both willing to accept without further discussion. They
may give explanations as to why they accept these arguments and argue
about which explanation is correct, but they will require no fur- ther
persuasive argument. At this juncture, Chalmers ( 2002 ) invokes the
notion of ideal rational reﬂection. Jago ( 2009 ) invokes the notion of
basic epistemic expecta- tions. Warren ( 2020 ) invokes Boghossian’s (
2003 ) “meaning entitlement connection” (p. 241) to argue that we are
automatically entitled to use the basic rules of our lan- guage,
although there is no constraint as to the sort of language a community
might adopt.</p>
<p>This leads us back to the idea that our conceptual toolbox may have
some con- straints. Logical systems formalize types of reasoning. The
logic of paradox, for instance, formalizes reasoning in which a sentence
A may be true while sentence A or B is false. Philosophers of logic
argue, using generally accepted informal rea- soning, that their
favourite logical theories should be preferred. The reasoning itself can
sometimes be challenged; abductive reasoning, for instance, is currently
under scrutiny, but in any given discussion some patterns of reasoning
must be taken for granted without requiring further persuasion. This
raises the question: are there pat- terns of reasoning whose correctness
we always take for granted? A positive answer could give us a wealth of
information about the necessary condition that the correct logical
system must satisfy, hence the constrained conceptual toolbox
metaphor.</p>
<p>Both Jago and Chalmers talk about the boundaries of epistemic space,
rather than reasoning. This requires one last clariﬁcation. The
epistemic space can be used to extensionally describe the rules
governing a given pattern of reasoning. Classical logic, for instance,
singles out a space of scenarios in which when A is true, A or B is also
true. Reasoning, on the other hand, is a pattern of behaviour largely
governed by implicit rules. Indeed, as Warren ( 2017 ) emphasises,
infants can follow a syntactic rule without being able to formulate it
and without performing any semantic operation (Pinker, 1999 ). Because
of this, it is quite unclear whether all patterns of reasoning can be
described in terms of the epistemic space. Therefore, I prefer to cut
the middleman and talk directly about rules of reasoning, but nothing
depends on this.</p>
<p>Chalmers and Jago suggest that our conceptual toolbox is normatively
constrained. The boundaries of the epistemic space should capture an
epistemic must; they tell us how we should reason. In particular,
Chalmers ( 2011 ) holds that while extremely non- ideal thinkers may
follow just any reasoning, the reasoning of ideal thinkers—which we
should follow—can be formalized by a logical system. Jago ( 2009 ), on
the other hand, focuses on non-ideal thinkers such as ourselves; the
normative constraints he places on our reasoning are loose and fuzzy.
Maddy ( 2007 ) also holds that these constraints of our conceptual
toolbox rule out some conceivable views, although she agrees with me
that these are biological constraints. Williamson ( 2007 ) and Warren (
2020 ), by contrast, hold that no reasoning can be excluded in
principle; our conceptual toolbox has no constraints. I argue that we
have strong empirical evidence to believe that human reasoning has
biological constraints. These constraints fail to rule out any
conceivable view in the philosophy of logic. We need to look elsewhere
to ﬁnd sufﬁcient reasons to prefer a view over another, but the
constraints of our conceptual toolbox can give us information about
necessary conditions.<br />
# 3 The experimental intractability dogma</p>
<p>Rationalists traditionally assume that we should focus on the
metaphysical, rather than biological constraints of our reasoning. This
is the idea that this matter is experimen- tally intractable. Here I
consider three ways to back this claim. First, I consider the view that
biological constraints cannot be studied because evidence is scarce.
Second, I consider the view that biological constraints should not be
studied, because we should rather be interested in the normative
boundaries of the epistemic space. Third, I con- sider the view that
biological constraints should not be studied because philosophers should
be interested in the most general features of the world, which have
nothing to do with how human reasoning happens to be constrained.</p>
<h1 id="empirical-evidence-of-human-cognitive-constraints-is-scarce">3.1
Empirical evidence of human cognitive constraints is scarce</h1>
<p>Naturalistic ally minded philosophers such as Warren seem to be
independently com- mitted to the idea that we should look for the
biological constraints of our reasoning. Indeed, Warren holds that our
disposition to follow an inference rule depends on our communities’
contingent choice of language. Thus, unlike the other authors I con-
sider, Warren cannot claim that biological constraints are irrelevant
because they are biological. In Warren’s view, however a community’s
contingent choice of language is constrained, these constraints affect
their logical and mathematical reasoning.</p>
<p>Warren’s evidence for his view is mostly non-experimental. For
instance, he argues that his view allows us to take at face value a
principle that many philosophers regard as plausible: charity “for any
language L and logical sentence <span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em>: <em>Φ</em></span> is true in L if and
only if <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span> is potentially
clearheadedly accepted by <span class="math inline">L</span> speakers”
(Warren, 2018 , p. 11).<br />
Now, I do not mean to suggest that non-experimental evidence is bad per
se, but rather that given Warren’s independent commitment to a
naturalistic methodology, it would be natural to seek experimental
support as well. At this juncture, Warren’s suggestion seems to be that
empirical evidence is scarce: “a full account of the inference role must
await the further development of cognitive psychology” (Warren, 2020 ,
Chap. 2 <span class="math inline">$\S6)$</span> .</p>
<p>It is certainly true that human cognition is still largely
mysterious. This does not imply, however, that Warren’s view is
impossible to evaluate empirically. Indeed, some evidence can be found
even without considering technical scientiﬁc literature. According to
Warren’s logical inferentialism, the meaning of logical expressions is
fully determined by the implicit inference rules governing it. Now, in
Italian, the word ‘non’—ordinarily translated as ‘not’—can sometimes be
used in assertive sentences. For instance, the sentence ‘I will stay
awake until my son will return’ translates as ‘rimarrò sveglio ﬁnché mio
ﬁglio non tornerà,’ which literally reads ’I will stay awake
untilmysonwill not return.’Thisiscalledpleonasticnegation.Warren’s( 2020
)criteria for an expression to be logical is that it should be
“non-empirical” and “topic-neutral”</p>
<p>(Chap. 3, §3). The Italian word ‘non’ seems to meet these conditions.
Therefore,</p>
<p>‘non’ and ‘not’ are not inter transl a table after all; and most
importantly, the reasoning of Italian speakers is structurally different
from the reasoning of English speakers. This seems factually false.
Italian logicians and mathematicians are not specially inclined to
reject double negation elimination even though in Italian double
negation can sometimes deny, let alone endorse a logic in which
sometimes a single negation afﬁrms. Indeed, I am aware of no Italian
logician suggesting that a single negation sometimes afﬁrms.</p>
<p>Warren may perhaps protest that ‘non’ and ‘not’ are stylistic
variants. This does not follow under his deﬁnition of stylistic
variants, since that requires that in two languages either a symbol type
can systematically be replaced for another, or gram- matical sentences
can be turned into grammatical sentences by replacing symbols in a
systematic way (Warren, 2018 , p. 5). Pleonastic negation is, by
Warren’s account, an implicit unsystematic rule in Italian; thus,
symbols cannot be replaced systematically. This said it is indeed
possible that the Italian pleonastic negation is nothing more than a
stylistic rule carrying no meaning. It may be difﬁcult for Warren to
develop an account of stylistic variations that can account for all
potential counterexamples, but I should not push this line of argument
further and consider instead technical scientiﬁc literature on
reasoning.<br />
Cesana-Arlotti et al. ( 2018 ) tested the reasoning of pre-verbal
infants aged between 12 and 19 months. In experiments 1–4, infants were
shown 24 movies in which a partially hidden object could be identiﬁed
using disjunctive syllogism. Success was measured by means of oculomotor
signs: pupil dilation and gazing direction. Experi- ments 5 and 6
compared the results from the ﬁrst four experiments with situations in
which the partially hidden object could be identiﬁed by direct
perception rather than disjunctive syllogism. Finally, experiment 7
compared the results from experiments 1–4 with the behaviour of adults.
Stable oculomotor markers could be detected in experiments 1–4 and 7
that were not detectable in experiments 5 and 6. This indicates,
according to Cesana-Arlotti et al., a neuro developmentally stable
pre-verbal precursor of logical reasoning.</p>
<p>This experiment repeated earlier results obtained on great apes and 2
years old infants (Call, 2004 ; Mody &amp; Carey, 2016 ), and it was
further repeated on grey parrots and monkeys, among other animals
(Pepperberg et al., 2019 ; Ferrigno et al., 2021 ). The Cesana-Arlotti
et al.’s experiment is especially interesting for the present purposes
because by using eye-tracking techniques it could study the inferential
dispositions of very young infants. The results seem to indicate that
humans have an innate, or at any rate pre-linguistical, disposition to
infer according to disjunctive syllogism. The results on non-human
animals indicate that this disposition is cross-species. This strongly
suggests that some human patterns of reasoning are not the result of
implicit conventions, or at any rate, they are not only the result of
implicit conventions; hered- itary factors play a role as well.</p>
<p>Warren might respond to this by invoking the notion of
“proto-reasoning,” to which he is independently committed ( 2020 , Chap.
2 §9). To account for the fact that non- human animals without
linguistic conventions are to some extent capable of reasoning, Warren
suggests that non-human animals could be capable of proto-reasoning. His
treatment of this matter is very brief, but we may presume it would
apply to pre-verbal infantsaswell.Thus,he could insist that the
precursor of d is jun ct ive syllogism detected in Cesana-Arlotti et
al.’s experiment is an example of pre-verbal reasoning. Young infants
are capable of proto-reasoning, but then in adulthood variations of
human languages—and hence reasoning—have inﬁnite degrees of freedom.
This response is weak because the precursor of disjunctive syllogism
seems neuro developmentally stable; it continues to affect human
dispositions after we learn a language. This entails, in Warren’s
disposition a list account of inference rules, that inference rules are
not entirely the result of linguistic conventions, or equivalently, that
human linguistic conventions are limited by the human genetic
makeup.</p>
<p>I tend to agree with Warren that we have a great deal of freedom to
choose our conceptual and linguistic tools. This said, it seems
extremely unlikely that reasoning should be an entirely conventional
phenomenon. Even if our reasoning depended entirely on our community’s
linguistic choices, this would not give it unlimited freedom. Indeed,
the human disposition to develop languages is itself genetically
constrained. It has long been known that the Broca region in the human
frontal lobe is crucial to language processing (Schiller, 1979 ).
Geneticists are now beginning to discover the features of our DNA
underpinning this. In the introduction, I mentioned the gene FOXP2. Its
mutation can cause a lack of activity in the Broca region and its
right-hemisphere counterpart, resulting in language disorder. Crucially,
subjects affected by this mutation show a signiﬁcant under-activation of
the Broca region dur- ing covert semantic search tasks, compared with
unaffected family members (Liégois et al., 2003 ). This indicates that
FOXP2 regulates not only the formation of neural pathways governing
mouth and tongue motor functions but also pathways realizing the human
ability to perform abstract semantic tasks. It seems hard to deny that
this imposes some constraints on the semantic features of languages that
humans can develop.<br />
Warren might hold fast to his metaphysical views despite this evidence.
He can concede that linguistic conventions are constrained by human
biology without thereby abandoning the idea that laws of logic are
nothing over and above linguistic conven- tions. However, Contrary to
Warren’s view, the epistemology of logic cannot be solely a matter of
determining what collective implicit choices were made in a given
linguis- tic community. Our common genetic makeup constrains our
conventions, and it might also account—at least to some extent—for the
commonalities we detect in human reasoning across linguistic
communities.</p>
<p>Later I discuss other features of the human brain realizing an
important aspect of our reasoning: the number sense. For the moment I am
concerned with whether experimental data about the constraints of the
human conceptual toolbox is available. The examples I have given thus
far should sufﬁce to show this. Questions on whether the human
conceptual toolbox has some constraints can be studied experimentally.
Speciﬁcally, there is experimental evidence indicating that not all our
reasoning is linguistically constrained and that our linguistic
reasoning is to some extent genetically constrained.</p>
<p>This leads us to a second way to support experimental intractability.
One might concede that the biological constraints of our reasoning can
be studied experimentally but insist that they have little philosophical
interest. This is the view that human cognitive limits have no bearing
on the boundaries of the epistemic space because the latter are
normative boundaries, and one cannot derive an ‘ought’ from an ‘is.’</p>
<h1
id="cognitive-constraints-have-no-bearing-on-normative-epistemic-constraints">3.2
Cognitive constraints have no bearing on normative epistemic
constraints</h1>
<p>Jago ( 2009 ) and Chalmers ( 2011 ) both emphasize that the
constraints they are inter- ested in should capture an epistemic must,
but their views diverge on how they deﬁne these normative boundaries.
Chalmers ( 2004 ) suggests that the normative boundaries of reasoning
should coincide with idealized mathematical knowledge. Here ideal- ized
means that we disregard subjects’ contingent cognitive limitations
(p. 208). Jago ( 2009 ) rejects this because it purportedly entails that
logical truths are uninforma- tive, and he introduces basic epistemic
expectations to take the normative role that idealization has for
Chalmers. Let us consider these views in order.<br />
Chalmers ( 2002 ) says that he takes the notion of idealization to be
primitive because he suspects that an attempted deﬁnition would be
open-ended and incomplete <span class="math inline">$(\S1)$</span> .
Nevertheless, we can infer that ideal reasoning does not involve any
capacity to prove unprovable truths. Indeed, Chalmers ( 2004 ) describes
a priori knowledge as akin to mathematical knowledge (p.209).
Accordingly, I assume that ideal agents cannot always prove, say,
whether a Turing machine will halt with a given input because that would
amount to solving the halting problem, which is provably unsolvable. If,
say, the continuum hypothesis is provable, then ideal agents can prove
it without breaking a sweat, but they cannot solve unsolvable problems,
decide undecidable sentences, or the like.</p>
<p>This leads us back to the distinction between persuasive and
explanatory arguments. Arguments proving that a given inference rule is
valid are rule circular. They might explain why the rule is valid, but
they cannot provide justiﬁcation or epistemic enti- tlement. One needs
to be entitled to use the rule prior to engaging in a rule-circular
argument to reach its conclusion. Accordingly, proving formally that a
given relation of logical consequence should be used is an impossible
task. One may prove, say, that in a system in which disjunction
introduction is valid, ex falso quodlibet is also valid, but one cannot
formally justify a whole logical system without rule-circularity, just
as one cannot prove a system’s axioms if not in the premise-circular
sense in which any axiom is also a theorem.</p>
<p>Here is an admittedly open-ended and incomplete deﬁnition: ideal
agents are cal- culators unconstrained by the number of steps they take
to solve a problem, memory, notational mistakes, and the like. Now,
under this deﬁnition, ideal reasoning, far from being a too restrictive
notion—as Jago has it—is too inclusive. Indeed, ideal agents are in
effect Turing machines. Thus, if the Church-Turing thesis is true, ideal
reason- ing coincides with formal reasoning. Ideal agents can decide all
sentences that are decidable under any arbitrary consequence relation.
However, they cannot choose a consequence relation, since unlike us,
when it comes to choosing a logical system they only accept formal
proofs as evidence.</p>
<p>At this juncture, one might challenge the assumption that ideal
agents only accept formal proofs as evidence.Thisresponse,itseems,is not
available to Chalmers.Indeed, Chalmers says that when it comes to
establishing the boundaries of the epistemic space, or epistemic
necessity, “a priori justiﬁcation must meet the sort of conclusive
standard associated with proof and analysis, rather than the weaker
standard associated with induction and abduction” ( 2004 , p. 209).
Ideal conceivability might be a guide to possibility, and indeed all
impossibilities might be ideally inconceivable (Chalmers, 2002 ).
However, ideal agents cannot inductively derive necessarily true claims
from ﬁnitely many observations that they cannot conceive, say, a round
square cupola. To get a priori justiﬁcation even ideal agents need
proofs. The only difference between ideal agents and us is that they
never make notational mistakes and the like, hence the suggestion that
they are, in effect, Turing machines, at least when it comes to
evaluating necessities.<br />
Even if we set aside Chalmers’s particular view, it seems difﬁcult for a
defender of this ideal agents rationalism to hold that a priori
justiﬁcation involves something other than formal proofs. Suppose that
ideal agents accept inductive or abductive arguments to gain priori just
i cation.Thenidealagents’justiﬁcationis,inacrucialsense,nobetter than
ours. Much of the appeal of thinking in terms of idealized a priori
justiﬁcation is that this should conclusively single out the correct
logical system. Induction and abduction are not conclusive. If a priori
justiﬁcation involves inconclusive means, then ideal agents are in our
same predicament of uncertainty when it comes to choosing the correct
logical system; thus, it becomes unclear why invoking the notion in the
ﬁrst place.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that ideal agents have some means other than formal
proofs of gain- ing conclusive justiﬁcation. Thus, they are somehow
capable of conclusively proving unprovable truths. In this view, ideal
agents have, by postulation, conclusive evidence to choose their formal
system, but this could not help in characterizing an epistemic must.
Humans cannot prove unprovable truths; the evidence that ideal agents
have access to is somewhat ineffable. Accordingly, it should not be
epistemically manda- tory for us to believe them; assuming that, in
general, one is never obliged to believe what one is incapable of
proving.</p>
<p>If ideal agents cannot gain justiﬁcation through inconclusive means
available to us, nor conclusive means unavailable to us, it seems
reasonable to conclude—as Chalmers does—that to establish which logical
system is correct, they use conclusive means that are also available to
us: formal proofs. However, because proofs that a given inference rule
is valid are rule-circular, they cannot provide them with justiﬁcation.
Therefore, ideal agents cannot be justiﬁed in choosing any logical
system. Like Turing machines, they can solve any decidable problem under
any arbitrary logical system, but their standards prevent them from
expressing a preference for a logical system.</p>
<p>Jago ( 2009 ) suggests that instead of reasoning in terms of ideal
agents, we should characterize the epistemic must in terms of the notion
of basic epistemic expectations. Although I have different reasons to
doubt Chalmers’s approach, I sympathise with Jago’s idea. My problem
here is with how Jago characterized our basic epistemic
expectations.</p>
<p>Jago suggests that any competent language user would recognize as
false sentences such as <span
class="math inline">$\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.~\aftergroup\egroup\right\bgroup=1'$</span>
and ‘ <span
class="math inline">$\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\cdot\mathclose\bgroup\left\|\Phi\Lambda\!\!\right\|\neg\phi\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left\|\Phi\right\rgroup$</span>
and we would all accept that 0 is 0 and not 1 and that wholly green
objects cannot be wholly red. I mentioned two counterexamples in the
introduction. Priest ( 1987 ) maintains that there are true
contradictions of the form <span
class="math inline">$\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.\mathrm{\ddot{q}}\Lambda\mathrm{\!\-\!}\phi\aftergroup\egroup\right.,$</span>
and Field ( 1980 ) argues that all mathematical sentences, including
<span class="math inline"><sup>⋅0</sup></span> is 0 and not <span
class="math inline"><sub>1</sub>,</span> are false. As far as I am aware
no philosopher currently maintains that 0 is 1. This, however, does not
show that the claim is undefendable. Consider Field’s idea that number
terms fail to refer in conjunction with the view that all non-referring
terms er to e same object, a null referring element. In this account,
<span
class="math inline">$\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.~\aftergroup\egroup\right.0=1'$</span>
is true, since ‘0’ and ‘1’ are non-referring terms and hence they both
refer to the null referring element. This view is probably false, but
there seems to be nothing in it that makes it impossible to believe for
a competent English speaker. Similar considerations apply to the claim
that wholly green objects cannot be wholly red. It does not seem hard to
cook up a metaphysical view in which wholly green objects can be wholly
red.<br />
It seems that, under the right assumptions, virtually any claim could
turn out to be true, or false. The relevant assumptions might be highly
implausible, or indeed provably false, but it seems difﬁcult to give an
example of a claim that one could conclusively prove or rule out on the
sole ground of one’s having linguistic compe- tence. Stroud ( 1968 )
suggested that any language user might be justiﬁed to believe that there
is a language, but again, this can be challenged. For instance, if
‘there is’ is understood as an existential quantiﬁed in a Quinean
meta-ontology and we presuppose a nominalist ontology, then the sentence
‘there is a language’ is false. Of course, a few examples are not enough
to prove that any claim could be rationally defended or rejected.
Indeed, it would be quite incoherent to suggest that any view could be
ratio- nally rejected and in the same breath claim that my view is
undeniable. My suggestion is that the abundance of counterexamples to
proposals that have been advanced so far gives us reason for a tentative
scepticism.</p>
<p>This is not to say, however, that the notion of epistemic expectation
should be discarded altogether. We do have some basic epistemic
expectations. For instance, we expect that any philosophical view should
be possible to formulate in a language that we can understand, otherwise
it would be unclear how we could consider the view at all. This does not
rule out any philosophical view. Indeed, it does not even rule out the
view that humans have no linguistic competence. In a brain in a vat
scenario, paired with behavioural views about linguistic competence, it
might be true that we have no linguistic competence, but this scenario
needs to be presented to us in a language we can understand if we are to
consider it. My suggestion is that the way human reasoning happens to be
constrained shapes our normative attitude toward thought. If potential
understand ability is an epistemic must, then the genetic constraints of
our linguistic reasoning contribute to determining the conditions for a
view to belong to the human epistemic space.</p>
<p>One might protest that, like Chalmers’s, my view is too inclusive:
the constraints of our reasoning are more restrictive than potential
understand ability. I argued that under the right assumptions, any claim
could turn out to be true, or false. Accord- ingly, the boundaries of
reasoning should not render any view true or false, but there might be
other constraints more restrictive than mine and less restrictive than
Jago’s. For instance, one could argue that we have the epistemic
expectation that everything presented to us should be supported with
evidence. This does not rule out any view, but it imposes a more
restrictive condition than potential understand ability, assuming that
we can understand views that are not supported by evidence.<br />
At this juncture, my suggestion is that we should distinguish linguistic
contexts: in academic journals, for instance, we expect that any view
should be supported with evidence. However, this is not a general
epistemic expectation. In some contexts, we have epistemic expectations
stricter than potential understand ability. On the other hand, if we are
interested in the expectations that apply to any context, then we should
consider what all humans have in common; the human genome naturally
suggests itself.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one might protest that, like Jago’s, my view is too
restrictive: per- haps the genetic constraints of our reasoning
determine the boundaries of the human epistemic space, but they fail to
capture epistemic space per se. This can be supported by claiming that
there might be aliens whose reasoning is not constrained in the way ours
is, which is indeed a nomological possibility: humans with a FOXP2
mutation are a real-world example of semantic aliens. Perhaps in the
future FOXP2 and other language-related genes will undergo a strong
negative selection in the human lineage and humans will develop the
ability to understand views that presently we cannot formulate.</p>
<p>I agree that our basic epistemic expectations are revisable. Hence,
it is possible to envision creatures that lack the constraints of our
reasoning. We cannot, however, envision what these creatures could tell
us; since, by deﬁnition, they talk in a lan- guage we cannot understand.
To characterize the epistemic must in terms of what any hypothetical
creature might ﬁnd intelligible amounts to denying that reasoning has
any epistemically normative constraints since we (and indeed any
creature) have no way of saying what hypothetical creatures could
express in languages we (they) cannot understand. However, for the
moment I am working under the assumption that views on the constraints
of reasoning should capture some sort of epistemic must. The present
version of the experimental intractability dogma presupposes exactly
that. For any creature, the constraints of that creature’s reasoning are
the broadest epistemic must they can accept without denying this
assumption. In our case, this results in a human-centric epistemic
space. This does not seem to be a problem; indeed, the human epistemic
standpoint, at the present stage of evolution, is our only epistemic
standpoint.</p>
<p>Let us turn now to the view that we should not reason normatively
about logic. One might defend the experimental intractability dogma
without embracing Chalmers’s and Jago’s views on the epistemic must. In
particular, one might hold that the laws of logic are maximally general
descriptive laws about the world; thus, the contingent constraints of
human reasoning have no bearing on descriptive general laws of logic,
because the world might sometimes be different from how our brain allows
us to reason about it.<br />
# 3.3 Cognitive constraints have no bearing on the most general features
of the world</p>
<p>Removing the assumption that the constraints of reasoning should
capture an epistemic must, the possibility of reasoning aliens becomes
more problematic. That is, those who hold—like Williamson ( 2013 )—that
logical facts are determined by general features of the world might
insist that cognitive constraints are irrelevant to the epistemology of
logic because the world might be different from how our brains allow us
to think about it. If the reasoning of reasoning aliens can be correct,
then a study of the contingent constraints of our reasoning could give
us no insight into truth preservation.</p>
<p>Haack ( 1982 ) points out that quite generally human reasoning can
lead to error. Many people, Haack remarks, believe that the gambler
fallacy is a correct pattern of reasoning. This is in no way an
indicator that the gambler fallacy is a correct pattern of reasoning,
which it is not. I should add that, indeed, the gambler fallacy might
have an evolutionary basis. Lyons et al. ( 2013 ) performed two
experiments to examine the relationship between betting behaviour and
the inhibition of return. This is an attention-shift phenomenon whereby
a stimulus draws a subject’s attention to a location and shortly
thereafter there is a delay in responding to stimuli coming from the
same location (Klein, 2000 ). Lyons et al. observed that subjects with a
stronger inhibition of return were also more likely to change betting
behaviour after a win. This, they suggest, indicates that there is a
correlation between inhibition of return and the gambler fallacy.
Possibly, the human probabilistic reasoning and attention system adapted
to presuppose non-random factors that make the same event unlikely to
occur twice in a short time interval, which is maladaptive in genuinely
stochastic scenarios.</p>
<p>In principle, I could set this issue aside. My main aim here is to
argue that our reasoning has constraints. Perhaps we are in a sorry
epistemic state and our reasoning very often leads us to error but, one
might argue, this has no bearing on whether human reasoning is
constrained. However, discussing this objection allows me to introduce
two important distinctions to clarify exactly how our genetic makeup
might affect our reasoning.</p>
<p>First,we should distinguish a subject’s beliefs from a subject’s
patterns of reasoning. Haack’s original point stresses that many people
believe that the gambler fallacy is correct. This might be a valid
example to press against Dummett’s ( 1973 ) view, which is the original
target of Haack’s criticism, but it is not a threat to my view. I argued
that any claim whatsoever could not only be believed by some subject but
also argued for; this includes the validity of the gambler fallacy. On
the other hand, I suggested that the human patterns of reasoning—which
are partially innate—affect what languages we can understand. The
constraints of reasoning, in my view, cannot preclude one from believing
any proposition one can understand, but they determine which
propositions one can understand. While the observation that humans often
believe falsehood has no bite, the observation that our innate patterns
of reasoning might often be misleading threatens the foundation of this
project. This is why I rephrased Haack’s original point in terms of
Lyons et al.’s experiments.<br />
Second, we should distinguish escapable from inescapable patterns of
reasoning. An escapable pattern of reasoning is one that, when given the
chance, humans tend to follow, but we might not follow it in some cases.
An inescapable pattern of reasoning is one that, when given the chance,
humans could only fail to follow due to brain lesions or genetic
disorders. This distinction is analogous to the familiar distinction
between voluntary and involuntary motor actions. An involuntary motor
action is an action that one may fail to perform only due to lesions or
genetic disorders, unlike a voluntary action.</p>
<p>Now, the gambler fallacy is clearly an escapable pattern of
reasoning. Many subjects follow it when given a chance, but not
everybody does. Indeed, professional poker players reason in a
probabilistic ally sound manner even under pressure.Thisskillmight not
be common, but surely humans can acquire it. Haack’s case is a
counterexample to the view that all widespread patterns of reasoning are
correct patterns of reasoning. I agree with Haack that this view is
incorrect. Correct reasoning might not be at all widespread. However,
for the moment I am concerned with necessary conditions for correct
reasoning—in particular, the features that all pieces of reasoning,
correct and incorrect, have in common—in this context, escapable
patterns of reasoning are clearly out of place; since, being escapable,
they do not constrain our conceptual toolbox.</p>
<p>I have yet to establish a crucial existence claim for inescapable
patterns of reasoning, but ﬁrst, let us appreciate what their existence
would entail. This leads us back to reasoning aliens. A professional
poker player is not a logical alien because the gambler fallacy is an
escapable pattern of reasoning. A logical alien is a subject that can
follow a reasoning that humans cannot follow, say by formulating it in a
language that we cannot understand. Suggesting that alien reasoning,
unlike ours, is correct amounts to advancing a sceptical scenario. We
cannot isolate the problematic parts of our reasoning, because to do so
we would need to follow alien reasoning. Therefore, everything we
believe is subject to doubt on the ground that ineffable reasoning might
refute it. Or, if the relevant inescapable reasoning is not
topic-neutral, anything that we believe on the topic is subject to doubt
on the ground that ineffable reasoning might refute it.<br />
This is a crucial juncture on which my views differ from Maddy’s ( 2007
). Although she might agree with my evaluation of both dogmas of
rationalism, our views differ in two important regards. First, she does
not distinguish escapable and inescapable patterns of reasoning. I do
not exclude that the cognitive processes that Maddy dis- cusses might be
inescapable. However, Maddy focuses on the fact that these cognitive
processes are detectable in young infants, and in members of other
species ( 2007 , pp. 264–270). The inhibition of return—which is
maladaptive in genuinely stochastic scenarios—can also be consistently
detected in young infants (Butcher et al., 1999 ), and in members of
non-human species (Gabay et al., 2013 ).</p>
<p>Second, Maddy holds that human cognitive constraints track logical
facts in a way that is not modally robust. In Maddy’s view, our
cognitive functions have adapted—or perhaps we acquire them “via more
general learning mechanisms” ( 2007 , p. 270)—to track features of the
actual world. Thus, if the actual world were different, so would our
cognitive functions. By contrast, in my view, our epistemic access to
the necessary conditions for the correct logical system need not be tied
to features of the actual world. I suggest that the only possible worlds
in which humanly inescapable patterns of reasoning fail to track logical
facts are worlds in which a radical sceptical scenario is actual. In
this scenario, some rules in all graspable logical systems are
incorrect. The correct rules are ungraspable; thus, we cannot identify
the problematic cases. Therefore, the entire human epistemic standpoint
should be impeached.</p>
<p>At this point, one might attempt a refutation of this sceptical
scenario. Perhaps an argument against this case can be developed along
the lines of other recent anti- sceptical arguments (Chalmers, 2018 ;
Rinard, 2018 ; Wright, 1991 ), but again, it is unclear that this is
required. It seems quite generally possible to conceive scenarios in
which, say, the laws of physics, or the laws of mathematics are humanly
impossible to know, and as a result, most or all human beliefs fall
short of knowledge. One should be wary of letting this sort of doubt be
a reason to impeach our epistemic standpoint. If the actuality of a
radical sceptical scenario is the only case in which the boundaries of
thought fail to track logical facts, then our trust in basic human
cognitive functions is as modally robust as our beliefs that we are not
brains in a vat. Brain in a vat scenarios can pose a challenge to any
sort of scientiﬁc knowledge, it is unclear that our epistemology of
logic should require any more modal robustness.</p>
<p>Here the notion of inescapable patterns of reasoning is doing much of
the philo- sophical heavy lifting. Accordingly, I should provide
evidence that there are some.<br />
There is one simple reasoning that I left somewhat implicit so far. This
starts with the assumption that humans cannot understand every possible
language, which entails that the patterns of reasoning that can be
phrased in the languages we can understand are humanly inescapable. Our
linguistic reasoning must follow one of those patterns, and we can
envision aliens understanding a language that we cannot.</p>
<p>This rests on the assumption that there are languages we cannot
understand. One way to support this assumption is to consider extremely
complex languages. Plausibly, humans cannot understand, say, a language
structurally identical to English with words so complicated to pronounce
that it takes a century to utter a sentence. This is not the right sort
of impossibility. The right sort of impossibility involves a
hypothetical language that is not structurally identical to any language
humans can understand. To support this, one can observe that human
linguistic abilities are realized by features of the human brain, which
are encoded in the human genome. Plausibly, no human trait has inﬁnite
degrees of freedom. For instance, not only our muscles cannot lift a
weight arbitrarily heavy, but they also cannot bend backwards. It is
unclear why human linguistic abilities should be an exception to this
regularity. If they are not an exception, then there are some linguistic
tasks that humans cannot perform, although in principle they can be
performed by creatures with a different brain structure realizing
different abilities. Of course, one can deny all this. To do so,
however, entails that human linguistic abilities are an unpassable
evolutionary peak. Many animals have limited linguistic abilities.
Bottlenose dolphins, for instance, have communication skills but they
cannot understand all nuances of human language (Janik, 2013 ). To deny
that there are languages that humans cannot understand amounts to
claiming that we could not possibly be in the same predicament, hence
the metaphor of an evolutionary peak. This notion is quite problematic
since it seems to presuppose a unilinear pattern of evolution that
modern biology resolutely rejects.</p>
<p>The main limit of this argument is that it can only establish that
human linguistic reasoning has some constraints. It cannot point out any
speciﬁc condition of possibil- ity for human knowledge. To do that I
need to consider concrete aspects of human reasoning that might
plausibly be inescapable. This ﬁnally leads me to the second dogma of
rationalism: reasoning is a linguistic phenomenon, or at any rate, it
can be described in linguistic terms.</p>
<h1 id="the-language-ﬁrst-dogma">4 The language ﬁrst dogma</h1>
<p>Traditional forms of rationalism tend to be susceptible to what we
may call the non- informativeness objection . They contend that some
conceivable views are inherently irrational,but when they mention spec i
c views,examples of seemingly rational agents defending them swiftly
emerge. For instance, Chalmers names a purportedly unde- niable
inference rule—conjunction introduction—when he says that only
“non-ideal reasoners [could] accept <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> while denying s&amp;t” ( 2011 ,
p. 6), and shortly thereafter, Russell ( 2018 ) argues against
conjunction introduction on seemingly rational ground. Chalmers can
respond to this that all sorts of views might seem rational from our
lim- ited viewpoint, but ideal agents can see through even the most
subtle of confusion. I argued above that this response is
unsatisfactory; ideal agents could only conclusively justify their
inference rules if they had some ineffable proof method unavailable to
us because the ones available to us—rule-circular formal proofs—cannot
provide jus- tiﬁcation. Even if we set this aside, Chalmers’s view
remains uninformative. In his traditional form of rationalism, some
conceivable inference rules can be ruled out a priori, but due to our
limited cognitive capacities, we are unlikely to ever know which ones
these are.<br />
The form of rationalism I am proposing is immune to this objection.
Indeed, I have argued that any conceivable view can be rationally
defended. The neurodevel- opmentally stable precursor of disjunctive
syllogism detected in young infants by Cesana-Arlotti et al. ( 2018 )—if
it is unescapable—might affect the reasoning of all logicians as they
develop their logical systems, but surely it does not do this to the
point of making paraconsistent logics irrational. Paraconsistent logics
are conceivable, and indeed it is perfectly possible to follow the
patterns of reasoning they prescribe. Therefore, they fall within the
boundaries of the epistemic space. Indeed, even the view that all
instances of disjunctive syllogism fail is conceivable and therefore it
could be rationally defended. Traditional forms of rationalism tend to
be uninfor- mative because they hold that some conceivable views are
inherently irrational, but they struggle to specify which ones. My
proposed view is immune to this because I hold that no conceivable view
is inherently irrational.</p>
<p>This being said, two variants of the non-informativeness objection
can be leveraged against my proposal. First, one might argue that my
view is uninformative because it does not rule out any conceivable
position. Second, one could argue that even if a view that does not rule
out any conceivable position can in principle be informative, mine is
not because I have not given enough details about how exactly the
epistemic space is constrained. I consider these two variants in
order.</p>
<p>Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that only views ruling out
some possibility can be informative, or else this objection would have
no leverage. Now, even with this assumption in place, there seems to be
space to argue that my view rules out some possibilities. Indeed, the
observation that there can be creatures reasoning in a way that we
cannot strongly suggests that there is something being ruled out. We
cannot express what is being ruled out in terms of a humanly
intelligible proof system, but we can describe the reasoning of logical
aliens in other terms. Crucially, we can describe the cognitive
processes, and biological machinery, from which our own linguistic
behaviour arises, and conversely, we can describe what a creature with a
different conceptual toolbox would be like. This is indeed what Liégois
et al. ( 2002 ) do in their study of humans with a FOXP2 mutation.</p>
<p>I label language ﬁrst dogma the view that the philosophical study of
logic should consist of an analysis of language. With this assumption in
place, it might seem that patterns of reasoning that humans cannot grasp
are impossible to describe. In fact, although we cannot phrase the
beliefs of logical aliens, we can describe, among other things, their
behaviour, linguistic and non-linguistic, and their brain structure.
There- fore, if the language ﬁrst dogma is abandoned, the suggestion
that the view I am proposing does not rule out anything—or, at any rate,
that it does not rule out anything that we can describe —loses its
apparent plausibility.<br />
One way to challenge the language ﬁrst dogma is to argue that our own
rea- soning—not only the reasoning of logical aliens—is not best
understood in purely linguistic terms. Above, I have mainly taken for
granted the language ﬁrst dogma. Indeed, I focused on human linguistic
reasoning, but none of the constraints of rea- soning I considered is
best understood in linguistic terms. The precursor of disjunctive
syllogism seems non-linguistic since pre-verbal infants have behaviour
consistent with it. The gambler fallacy seems related to the inhibition
of return, which is an attention- shift phenomenon. Even FOXP2 might
primarily regulate non-linguistic behaviour. Schreiweis et al. ( 2014 )
genetically engineered mice to carry the human FOXP2. These, compared to
non-engineered mice, were quicker to transition from procedu- rally
learning a task to performing it automatically. Schreiweis et
al. conjecture that the human FOXP2 improved our ancestor’s ability to
use procedural forms of learn- ing to automatize tasks. However this
might have affected the emergence of human language, it is unclear that
it is best described in terms of what sort of beliefs humans can have,
or what sort of sentences we can assent to.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that the study of language can help us
understand thought. How- ever, we should be wary of generalizing this to
the claim that the study of language is our only means to understand
thought. Not only can we reason informally without employing a decidable
proof system, but much of our reasoning is also not linguistic at all.
Moreover, even when we do reason using a language, we exercise abilities
that cannot obviously be described in linguistic terms. One might
protest that linguistic reasoning and speciﬁcally formal reasoning is
somewhat better than non-linguistic reasoning. Warren ( 2020 ), for
instance, suggests that we can engage in complex rule- following because
we are linguistic creatures, or at any rate, “it is hard to imagine
non-linguistic creatures doing it” (Chap. 2 §9). The problem with this
is that even if linguistic reasoning were in general better than
non-linguistic reasoning, this would only matter to single out the
sufﬁcient conditions for correct reasoning. As far as we are interested
in the necessary conditions for correct reasoning, a study of language
cannot bring us very far. Because we can reason without employing any
language; infants can learn a language without knowing any, and even if
infants could ‘speak’ the language of thought (Fodor, 1975 ), it seems
hard to maintain that adults with a lesioned Broca region can.<br />
This addresses the ﬁrst variant of the non-informativeness objection. It
is not pos- sible to say what logical aliens believe or to state the
inference rules that they follow. Nevertheless, we can describe their
patterns of reasoning, and indeed the boundaries of our own conceptual
toolbox, in other terms. This response is not ad hoc because we have
independent reasons to think that our most basic patterns of
reasoning—from which we build ﬁrst linguistic competence and later
logical competence—are non- linguistic. Indeed, non-linguistic cognitive
processes are the most plausible candidates for cognitive constraints
affecting the entirety of our reasoning, including formal rea-
soning.</p>
<p>The second variant of the non-informativeness objection, on the other
hand, still lingers. One could argue that although the non-linguistic
boundaries of human rea- soning can in principle be described, I have
not adequately described them. It is unclear, for instance, whether the
aforementioned precursor of disjunctive syllogism is inescapable; that
is, we do not know if humans are able to voluntarily suspend its
activity. We can be reasonably certain that however FOXP2 constraints
our linguistic reasoning, it does this inescapably; one cannot
voluntarily and reversibly experience aphasia. However, it is still very
unclear how FOXP2, among other genes, constrains our linguistic
reasoning.Schreiweisetal.( 2014 )suggest that it improved our ancestor’s
ability to automatize tasks. It is unclear that this can be anyhow
related to questions that rationalists have been traditionally
interested in concerning the justiﬁcation of mathematical or logical
knowledge.</p>
<p>There is a grain of truth to this last objection. As I pointed out
above, the func- tioning of the human brain is still largely mysterious.
Consequently, there is indeed much to be discovered about our basic
cognitive functions. This is not to say, how- ever, that presently there
is no hope to relate studies about biological constraints of human
reasoning with traditional rationalist questions. Studies on the number
sense, for instance, give us reason to be hopeful.</p>
<p>The number sense is aninescapable, inherited cognitive function that
allows humans and other animals to make approximate calculations. It has
been argued that there is a mapping between the number sense and the
reasoning prescribed by elementary arith- metic (Dehaene, 2011 ). Some
disagree on this (Everett, 2017 ), but there is consensus that the
number sense corresponds to at least some of the reasoning prescribed by
elementary arithmetic. One can rationally reject all arithmetical
sentences—as Field ( 1980 ) does—but one cannot cease to reason in a way
that maps to at least some basic arithmetic, and as we saw above, unless
we inhabit a sceptical scenario these patterns of reasoning are
truth-tracking.</p>
<p>Dehaene ( 2011 ) describes the number sense as an inherited capacity
that we share with other animals to rapidly perceive, compare, and
calculate the approximate mag- nitude of collections of objects (Chap.
10). This consists of at least two abilities to represent numbers
without counting: the small-number system represents exactly sets of 1,
2, or 3 objects, and the large-number system represents greater
quantities with increasing approximation (Hyde &amp; Spelke, 2009 ;
Revkin et al., 2008 ). Subjects with brain damage undermining their
number sense might be able to speak, perform symbolic calculations, and
memorize a multiplication table but they might fail simple subtractions
and number comparisons calling to point out the largest of two one-ﬁgure
Arabic numerals (Dehaene &amp; Cohen, 1997 ). This indicates a
dissociation between linguistic knowledge and arithmetical knowledge.
Brain activity consistent with the adult number sense was detected in
pre-verbal infants (Berger et al., 2006 ; Izard et al., 2008 ). This
indicates that the number sense is an inherited capacity. Moreover,
subjects whose number sense is undamaged seem unable to suspend its
activity. For instance, the sense-perception component of the number
sense cannot be switched off: humans without acalculia when presented
with a collection of two objects and a collection of ten cannot suppress
the perception of a difference in magnitude (Burr and Ross, 2008 ). This
suggests that the number sense is inescapable.<br />
Humans can deny all arithmetical propositions, as Field ( 1980 ) does.
It seems, however, that the number sense amounts to a constraint of our
conceptual toolbox, at the present stage of evolution. We may deny that
50 minus 2 is 48, but we cannot suppress the perception that a
collection of 50 objects minus 2 is only slightly less than 50. Now,
according to Dehaene, the number sense informs much of our arithmetical
thinking and even formal theories of arithmetic. If this is true, it
would effectively vindicate Kant’s idea that the foundation of our
arithmetical knowledge lies in the constraints of our perception or
imagination. Kant argues that no collection of objects we might perceive
or abstractly think about can violate the principles of arithmetic, and
this—assuming that we do not live in a sceptical scenario—justiﬁes us to
believe the principles of arithmetic. If Dehaene is right, then we might
ﬁnally have the empirical evidence to back Kant’s claim. Kant did not
foresee the possibility that someone could perceive differences in
magnitudes and yet deny arithmetical claims, as Field does.
Nevertheless, we might be able to use Kant’s reasoning to back our
entitlement to follow arithmetical reasoning.</p>
<p>As it happens, though, the claim that the number sense informs much
human arith- metical thinking and formal theories of arithmetic is
controversial. Everett ( 2017 ) argues that our arithmetical reasoning
is only mildly constrained by the number sense, and most of it is a
linguistic convention. Everett’s case study focuses on anumeric
populations, these are populations that speak languages without number
words or theories of arithmetic. The subjects in Everett’s studies tend
to solve correctly tasks involving groups of 1, 2, or 3 objects. This
indicates that the small-number system strongly informs their reasoning.
However, anumeric people regularly fail tasks involv- ing collections of
4 or more objects, contrary to Dehaene’s prediction that the level of
approximation of the large-number system should very gradually increase
as the size of the collection of objects increases.</p>
<p>Everett does not deny the existence of the number sense. Indeed, his
ﬁndings con- ﬁrm that the small-number system informs the reasoning of
anumeric populations.<br />
He suggests, however, that the constraints of human reasoning leave a
great deal of freedom to our arithmetical thinking, to the point that an
anumeric person may fail to see a difference between a collection of
four objects and a collection of ﬁve objects. I do not wish to take a
position on this debate here but only emphasize that this matter is
experimentally tractable. If Dehaene is right, then much of our
arithmetical rea- soning—our reasoning about positive integers—is
informed by the number sense. If Everett is right, only our reasoning
about the numbers 1, 2, and 3 is genetically con- strained. Either way,
the scientiﬁc consensus seems to be that arithmetical reasoning has some
constraints that are not linguistic, inescapable, and inform our
linguistic reasoning, they inform at least our linguistic reasoning
about the numbers 1, 2, and 3. This not only constitutes evidence
against the language ﬁrst dogma, but it also gives us a more qualiﬁed
description of the condition of possibility of human knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="rationalism-without-the-dogmas">5 Rationalism without the
dogmas</h1>
<p>Frege and Russell argued, contra Kant, that the justiﬁcation of
arithmetic lies in the principles of logic, which govern all correct
reasoning. This paradigmatic shift led generations of analytic
philosophers to focus on language to understand thought. This matter
should be studied abstractly, it is often assumed, because we are
interested in thought in general, not in the contingent features of
human thought. I called these the language ﬁrst dogma and the
experimental intractability dogma.</p>
<p>There is a sense in which the dogmas seem quite correct. If we are to
specify the features of a correct logical system it is very unclear that
the way humans happen to reason should inform our inquiry, and
linguistic reasoning, thanks to its topic- neutrality, seems an
excellent tool to express our views. I called this the project of
providing sufﬁcient conditions for correct reasoning. Plausibly, in the
pursuit of this project, we should aim at scientiﬁc consilience rather
than trying to model widespread patterns of reasoning.</p>
<p>In another sense, however, these dogmas seem quite problematic. If we
are to specify the minimum features that all reasoning must have, then
it is dubious that we should focus only on linguistic reasoning, or that
the contingent constraints of human reasoning should make no difference.
I called this the project of providing necessary conditions for correct
reasoning.</p>
<p>Kant, Frege, and Russell thought that the necessary conditions for
correct reasoning are also sufﬁcient to single out a logical theory and
a theory of mathematics. Kant thought that principles constraining our
logical reasoning single out syllogistic logic, and the pure intuitions
of space and time which constrain how objects can be given to us, single
out mathematics. Frege thought that the principles constraining our
logical reasoning single out classical logic and arithmetic, and pure
intuitions single out geometry. Russell thought that the constraints of
logical reasoning single out both classical logic and mathematics.</p>
<p>These views are false. Humans can rationally deny the principles of
classical logic and the principles of mathematics. That is, the
constraints of our reasoning leave us much more freedom than Kant,
Frege, and Russell thought. We should not hastily conclude,however,that
reasoning has no constraints at all.Empirical evidence strongly suggests
that basic human arithmetical reasoning is non-linguistically
constrained by inherited traits. This partly vindicates Kant’s view on
this matter, although not without much rephrasing.<br />
One could invoke the notion of reasoning aliens to argue that we might
lack enti- tlement to reason in the way we do. If there are other sorts
of reasoning, those might be correct rather than ours. This amounts to a
form of scepticism. The number sense un controversially constrains human
reasoning about collections of 1, 2, or 3 objects. Conjecturing that we
might sometimes lack entitlement here—given that we cannot possibly
identify the problematic cases—amounts to conjecturing that we always
lack entitlement when we reason about small groups of objects. Kant
attempted to rule out sceptical scenarios, but he was never quite
satisﬁed with his arguments against scepticism (Guyer, 1983 ). We might
be now in a better position to reject scepticism (Chalmers, 2018 ;
Rinard, 2018 ; Wright, 1991 ), or we might embrace Frege’s attitude on
this matter and simply remark that denying our epistemic standpoint is
“an attempt to jump out of one’s own skin against which I can only
urgently warn” (Frege, 2016 , p. xvii). Either way, there seems to be a
philosophical value in assessing the neces- sary conditions for correct
reasoning, although they have turned out to be much less restrictive
than Kant and Frege thought.</p>
